            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Main part of the Work which the Lord Jeſus has committed to me at preſent, is to be doing ſervice to your Souls, and the Souls of your Children; to be directing, quickening and encouraging of you in the way unto eternal life: which work requires the utmoſt care and diligence, not only in reſpect of the neceſſity that you ſtand in, of that bleſſedneſs which is the deſign and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency thereof, but alſo in reſpect of that difficulty that you will unavoidably meet withal, in your purſuit of that bleſſedneſs:
<pb facs="tcp:192038:3"/>however many men that know not their own hearts, and are utterly unexperienced in the way of life, may fancy it to be a matter of eaſe to go to heaven, as if there were but a ſtep between them and heaven, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account are bold to caſt off all care about it at preſent; yet ſuch as have tried it, and are walking in that way, can upon plentiful experience witneſs to what Chriſt has taught us, <hi>That ſtrait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leadeth unto Life:</hi> every thing in corrupt nature is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to it: and upon this account he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Miniſters to uſe their utmost indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in their work, <hi>Luk. 14.23. Compel them to come in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have travelled in this work among you for many years, and I may ſay without oſtentation, that I <hi>have obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful:</hi> I have made it my buſineſs to gain Souls to Chriſt, and build them up in Faith and holineſs: prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally inſiſting upon ſuch things as have reached the heart of Religion; and I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon it one of the choiceſt mercies of the Lord towards me, that I have <hi>not run in
<pb facs="tcp:192038:3"/>vain nor laboured in vain:</hi> I have great cauſe to bow my knee to the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and bleſs his Name that he has made me an inſtrument of bringing many among you into ſaving acquaintance, with himſelf; and I count it worth the while to ſpend the reſidue of my dayes in promoting the welfare of your Souls.</p>
            <p>It is in purſuance of this deſign, that this ſmall Treatiſe is publiſhed, (not that my care is confined to your ſelves, I owe a regard to the proſperity of other places:) the ſcope of this Diſcourſe is to clear up the way of Salvation by Chriſt; I meddle not with thoſe falſe Doctrines that have been invented by men, in oppoſition to this truth: the Lord hath been pleaſed to keep theſe Churches ſound in the Faith, and does not yet lay a neceſſity upon his Miniſters here to ſpend their time in the confutation of ſuch erronions Opinions: but I have made it my work to establiſh your hearts in this Truth, to ſatisfie your Conſciences from the Scripture in the ſafety of your reliance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ, vindicating the ſame from thoſe ſecret workings of unbelief that are wont to
<pb facs="tcp:192038:4"/>riſe up in the hearts of men, that you and others may grow up <hi>unto all the riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, and the acknowledgment of the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, even of the</hi> Father, <hi>and of</hi> Chriſt: That you may be armed againſt thoſe temptations wherewith your Faith is wont to be aſſaulted; and learn to live in all conditions upon the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If the Lord pleaſe to bleſs this Diſcourſe together with other endeavours of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Countrey, both in Preaching and Writing, to be a means to bring many Souls to an hearty cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, that will be the great ſecurity of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey againſt that degeneracy that is begun, and againſt thoſe ſuperſtitious practiſes that are entertained in other profeſſing places: the life of Religion takes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the ſpiritual knowledg of Chriſt, and is maintained by the ſame; as long as we are built upon this Rock, the Gates of Hell will not prevail againſt us.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:192038:4"/>
            <p>The Lord who has watched over you in the time of dayes when you lay open to the fury of the Heathen; and that has given ſpecial tokens of his Preſence with you in his Ordinances, both in the dayes of your former Paſtor, and alſo in late times; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to own and bleſs you, and enrich you with all the Graces of his Spirit; and give you Faith to ſit under the ſhadow of Christ with great delight: Which is the Prayer of Him who is</p>

                  <p>The Introduction ſhewing the Difficulty of Believing this Truth.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere is ſuch Light remaining in the Conſcience of fallen Man, as has made him inquiſitive after a way of acceptance with God: and though ſeveral particular perſons do not ordinarily. concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about it: yet in all Nations and Ages there have been thoſe that have made it matter of ſolemn ſearch: the abundant evidence that men have of the being, purity, juſtice and greatneſs of God, in conjunction with the teſtimony of their own hearts concerning their guilt, has made them
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:192038:6"/>reſtleſs till they can come at ſome ſatisfaction in this point: men have been ſtudious in many other points, from a thirſt after knowledg and to gratifie their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; but in this enquiry they have been much influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the cryes and diſquietneſs of their own bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened Conſciences: the fearful apprehenſions of Gods anger have ſpurred them on to diſcover a way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: they have not been able ſo to ſtupifie their hearts with worldly occaſions and carnal delights; as to let fall the conſideration of this, but have been compelled from their own terrors to make that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, as they <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Many men who have buſied themſelves in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry have not been advantaged to attain a right reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution thereof; the Heathen Nations had loſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the way of Salvation: ſomething in Religion was handed down to them by tradition: and ſomething particularly that had a reference unto Jeſus Chriſt; eſpecially Sacrifices: but the knowledg of the reſpect they had to him was quite worn out among them, and the light of nature is utterly deficient in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: that light is ſufficient to diſcover to us that God is provoked with us, that knowledg flows from our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the nature of God, and the experience which we have of our own ſinfulneſs: but the way of reconciliation does exceed the diſcovery of reaſon: the light of nature does not teach us that there is any way of reconciliation; much leſs does it teach us what it is: the light of nature may diſcover to us that many pretended wayes of acceptance are deluſions; for it is contrary unto reaſon to imagine that God will take up with ſuch things: but to determine what is the way, is clearly beyond the moſt raiſed underſtanding of man without divine revelation, upon a ſuppoſition that there was a poſſibility of any other way of acceptance for ſinners beſides this by Jeſus Chriſt (and I know no
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:192038:6"/>ground from Scripture to ſay that God was confined to this way; that he was neceſſitated if he would ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, to take this courſe in order to his Salvation) it will unavoidably follow that the light of nature will leave man ſhort of this knowledg: how can the light of nature reach the free determination of the Will of God? but beſides this the knowledg of the way of our acceptance with God through Chriſt does neceſſarily ſuppoſe the knowledg of thoſe two great myſteries; that of the holy Trinity, and that of the Incarnation of the Son God, which do utterly ſurpaſs all the dictates of the light of nature: <hi>Fleſh and blood reveals not thoſe things, but the Father that is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 16.17. hence the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were utterly miſtaken as to this way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>became vain in their imaginations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides theſe, there are many others, who have been advantaged with the light of the Goſpel that have been unſatisfied in that account which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have given concerning the way of our acceptance, and have pleaded for ſuch methods of Salvation as the Word of God is utterly a ſtranger to: withal wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many paſſages of Scripture to vindicate their own deluſions: thus as the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, ſo eſpecially the <hi>Papiſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Socinians</hi> now go about to eſtabliſh a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which the Goſpel does not acknowledg: and fix upon a way of acceptance with God, that has no better foundation than their own ſophiſtical reaſonings, this is not to be attributed to any obſcurity in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; in the matter of our Juſtification; but greatly to the pride that men have in their own underſtandings: carnal reaſon ſuggeſts that otherwayes are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable than that which is commended to us by God: carnal reaſon is full of objections againſt the Doctrine of our acceptance by Chriſts righteouſneſs: and men know not how to deny their own reaſon, they dent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a ſence upon their hearts of the imperfections and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:192038:7"/>deceits of their own reaſon: they know not what dim ſighted things they are; carnal reaſon is a thing much idolized: many men have not learned that leſſon to be ſatisfied in the teſtimony of God, but make their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the rule and meaſure of Principles in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: lay ſo much weight upon their own reaſon, that they judg things muſt be ſo as their reaſon repreſents them, loth to entertain any thing in matters of Faith, that they do not ſee with their own eyes, partly to the enmity of the hearts of men unto this way of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by Chriſt: this way of Salvation is very ſuitable to our neceſſities, but no wayes ſuitable to our natural diſpoſition: mans heart would ſooner fall in with ſuch a way of Salvation, wherein he might have ſomewhat of his own to glory in; this way tends much to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting of God, and abaſing and emptying of man: the ſpirit of man is to ſet up his own righteouſneſs, and not be beholden unto the righteouſneſs of another; which makes men unwilling to believe this Doctrine of our acceptance by Chriſt: and this oppoſition of the heart hereto prepares men to receive the contrary Doctrine: Arguments that have little ſtrength in them will take great impreſſion upon men of corrupt minds; where there is ſtrength of affections, plauſible pretences will gain conſent; ſlender proofs will ſerve the turn where mens ſpirits are ſtrongly byaſſed.</p>
               <p>But it were well if none elſe did reject this Doctrine, but only thoſe that do profeſſedly plead againſt it: there be multitudes that do joyn in making this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that are far from entertaining it: how high ſo ever mens profeſſions be, there are no more that do thorowly believe this than are regenerated and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called: there is a kind of perſwaſion of it which carnal men may have, which perſwaſion the Scriptures ſometime calls Faith; but it is ſuch a perſwaſion as leaves men really ignorant of this Truth: ſome men
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:192038:7"/>have a perſwaſion of it wrought by tradition, becauſe it is handed down to them from former Generations, and generally received in the places where they live; or by thoſe that they have particular eſteem for: upon the ſame account that a <hi>Turk</hi> gives credit unto the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his Religion: <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.11. the Doctrine is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon the authority and teſtimony of man, which leaves the Soul under ſuch uncertainty as quite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the ſpiritual efficacy of the truth upon their hearts. There is a perſwaſion that ariſes from rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal convictions, their reaſon tells them that other wayes of acceptance are frivolous; that of all wayes that are pretended this muſt needs be the true way: and they can ſtrongly argue that there is acceptance to be obtained in this way: from the accompliſhment of the covenant of works by Chriſt from the deſign of God to magnifie his Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this perſwaſion is not ſufficient to encourage a foul to venture himſelf on Jeſus Chriſt. There fs alſo a perſwaſion that ariſeth from common illumination: beſides that light which is let into the hearts of men in their converſion: there is a more than ordinary illumination beſtowed upon ſome ſinners, the ſpirit of God gives an affecting ſight of the way of Salvatipn, enlightning natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with a great diſcovery of the way of life by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: this is called <hi>a taſting of the good Word of God,</hi> Heb 6.5. the fruit whereof is a rejoycing in the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. this illumination is only by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary aſſiſtance of mens natural reaſon, not by giving an eye of Faith unto them: neither is this light ſufficient to ſatisfie all the objections which may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ariſe in the heart: hence ſuch men if afterwards they have a thorow ſight of their hearts; dare not venture their ſouls on Chriſt, till God by a further work of the Spirit has convinced them of the certainty of the Goſpel: but there is no man how great ſoever his profeſſion, how large ſoever his knowledg is, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:192038:8"/>continues in a natural condition, does thorowly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe this truth.</p>
               <p>This I ſhall clear up by two Conſiderations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe all thoſe that do thorowly believe this, will immediately venture themſelves upon Chriſt: as there is no perſwading of men before to come to Chriſt, ſo there can be no keeping of them from Chriſt after they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this:</hi> the aſſurance of the truth of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> is ever accompanied with a powerful operation of it upon the heart, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Theſſ</hi> 1.5. God teacheth men the truth of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and thereby prevails with them to come to Chriſt: in that way it is the Father puts forth his drawing power, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, 45. the <hi>Goſpel</hi> alwayes works effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where it is believed and received as the truth <hi>of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. God carries on all his works upon the hearts of his Elect in a way of conviction: the devils way of working is by blinding of man, by prejudice and falſe reaſons: but Gods way of working is by teaching of men; thus God carries on preparatory work, and thus he carries on ſaving work: God deals with men as with rational creatures, and prevails upon their hearts in a way ſuitable to thoſe natures; though he put forth acts of power yet not <hi>of violence</hi> on the Will: but he gains the conſent of that by the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of thoſe reaſons that are of ſufficient weight to ſway it; indeed the underſtanding and will in man being faculties of the ſame ſoul and really one and the ſame thing, the ſame act of God upon the Soul that puts light into the underſtanding, does alſo ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly incline the will: God works all holy inclinations in the will by convincing us, and making us believe thoſe truths that are the grounds of them: we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and love, believe and repent, believe and fear, believe and ſubmit, believe and ſo venture on Chriſt: God convinces us of the truth of the Goſpel, and that there is ſufficient righteouſneſs for us in Chriſt, and ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192038:8"/>we come to him, <hi>John</hi> 16.10. and therefore all thoſe that are aſſured of the truth of the Goſpel, do cloſe with Chriſt and are regenerated: and this leads us to the interpretation of ſeveral paſſages of Scripture: where ſuch Men as aſſent to the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are ſaid to be in a good condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If shou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with thine heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> 1 Joh. 4.15. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he is in God:</hi> 1 Joh. 5.1. <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt is born of God:</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. <hi>Who is he that overcometh the World, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God:</hi> Theſe paſſages are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of that Faith which is common to Profeſſors; that Faith that may be ſeparated from holineſs, which <hi>James</hi> calls a dead Faith, <hi>Jam</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> but of that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that is wrought in the heart by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing that clears it is: that when natural men fall under the awakening work of the Spirit, they immediately call the Goſpel &amp; in particular this truth of the ſafety of our appearing in Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs into queſtion: though they might ſeem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to themſelves and others well ſatisfied; yet when ever, they come to lie under the ſenſe of Gods anger and Conſcience is writing bitter things againſt them; they are full of ſcruples and objections againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; tis a long time uſually before ſuch perſons can give entertainment to this Truth: and when it is done it is wrought in them by the mighty power of God: all that Miniſters can urge upon them will not take place, the choiceſt Evidences will not ſink into them till God opens their hearts, as he opened the heart of <hi>Lydia:</hi> ſometimes the hearts of ſuch men will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting againſt this way in general, as if there were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192038:9"/>not ſalvation for ſinners in this way; they ſcruple how the righteouſneſs of one will avail for the Salvation of another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but principally their ſcruples are reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in particular, they are not ſatisfied that God calls them: that there is enough in Jeſus Chriſt for the waſhing away of their ſins: that God would take it well for them to venture themſelves on Chriſt: they think they muſt be better firſt, and more broken for their ſins: this is directly contrary to the Doctrine of the Goſpel; for the Goſpel does not only teach in general that there is ſalvation in Chriſt for ſinners: but that it is ſafe for any that will, be they never ſo blind, hard-hearted, impenitent and rebellious and guilty to venture themſelves on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: men do not only oppoſe the Goſpel, when they queſtion whether Believers ſhall be ſaved, but when they que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether there be ſufficient encouragement for them to come to Chriſt:</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of natural men that are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, not only to the belief of the truth of the Goſpel, but alſo to truſting in Jeſus Chriſt, which upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will be found to deceive themſelves: one ſort are, many unawakened ſinners, ſome of whom are not ſo much as civilized, nor of moral converſation; yet they profeſs to place their truſt in Jeſus Chriſt: ſuch as thoſe the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> expoſtulates with, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2 14. <hi>ad finem:</hi> but what ever ſuch men ſay concerning their putting their truſt in Chriſt: the real foundation of this hope is an ignorance that they have offended God: they may pleaſe themſelves ſometimes with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral notion that Chriſt has wrought out redemption for ſinners: and make a little uſe of Chriſt dying for ſinners to quiet their hearts; but the bottom of their confidence lies in this, that they are ſtrangers to the provoked juſtice of God: they dont think that God is angry for their ſins; they live a life of carnal ſecurity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192038:9"/>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21.55. &amp; 11.9, the other ſort are ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſinners, who ſay they put their confidence in Chriſt: but their great encouragement is, that they have attained ſomewhat that does draw the heart of God unto them: there are many ſelf-righteous men, that do not profeſs any truſt in their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: they have been ſo trained up in the contrary Doctrine that they could not quiet their own hearts if they knew that they did it: but yet under a notion of reſting upon Chriſt they reſt upon themſelves: their religious qualifications are their main ſtay: they are far from putting themſelves upon a ſtrict Trial by the Law: but they imagine ſome excellence in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that is their encouragement to go to Chriſt: the <hi>Jews</hi> made account their works would do much towards their Salvation; the grace of God making up the defects thereof, <hi>Rom</hi> 9.32. ſo do thoſe truſt partly to their works, partly to Chriſt, making a mixture of the Law and Goſpel: and both theſe ſorts of men, notwithſtanding their pretences are ſtrangers to the ſafety of appearing in Chriſts righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And as natural men do not truly believe this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; ſo Saints themſelves have but little belief of it: the people of God may juſtly fall under that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.25. <hi>Fools and ſlow of heart to believe:</hi> there are times when God is pleaſed abundantly to aſſure the Souls of his people of this truth, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5. the fruit whereof is a ſweet and quiet reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jeſus Chriſt: but the natural unbelief of the heart is darkening that light which God has put in, and though it cant utterly extinguiſh it, yet it raiſes many miſts that do obſcure it: <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf that ſeems to be ſecond to none in the knowledg of Chriſt; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that he was ſenſible of a great want here, in that expreſſion, <hi>that he may know him &amp; the power of his reſurrection,</hi> Phil. 3.10.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:192038:10"/>
               <p>There are theſe frames of heart that the people of God are ſubject unto, that do plainly demonſtrate, that there is but little Faith concerning this Doctrine: the firſt is a ſlighty frame concerning it, as if it were not a matter of much moment whether it were true or no: ſometimes when Saints are meditating of it, or hearing of it, and the invitations of grace, there is a ſenſeleſs and regardleſs frame, as if it were not worthy obſervation: Diſcourſes of that kind are not reliſhed, but become light food; whereas if it were received by a lively Faith, it would be affecting being a thing of greateſt concernment: the Doctrine of the Goſpel when entertained by Faith is as a cordial to the Soul, it is meat and drink to it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3 <hi>I ſat under his ſhadow with great delight:</hi> this Doctrine is full of ſweetneſs and comfort, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.34. the more aſſurance men have of the truth of it, the more comforting power it has on the heart: The ſecond is a ſelf righteous frame; for as this ſpirit reigns in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny natural men: ſo it prevails much in Saints, there is a great aptitude to be comforting of themſelves in the hopes of acceptance with God from their own graces and duties, not only as an evidence, but as that which does ingratiate them with God; hence they are more ready to truſt in God when under the ſence of gracious frames, and their holy carriages then at other times; whereas were they under the lively apprehenſions of the certainty of this way of Salvation by Chriſts righteouſneſs; they would ſee there were no need of theſe things to commend them to God, and were there not ſecret jealouſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſufficiency of Chriſts righteouſneſs for them, they would not be ſo ready to catch at any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſomewhat in themſelves to commend them to God; ſuch carriages are to be layed to the charge of an unbelieving heart. The third is a diſcouraged frame, Chriſtians are many times much over-born
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:192038:10"/>with this frame, their ſpirits are ſunk within them leſt they be not upright, for fear they never had a thorow work of regeneration: there are many more immediate occaſions of this, ſometimes becauſe they have not a diſtinct knowledg of the ſeveral ſteps of the ſpirit of God under the work: ſometimes becauſe they ſee ſo little ſanctification, ſometimes becauſe they imagine that God does not deal with them as with ſuch as are truly converted; he dont anſwer their prayers, comfort their Souls, meet them in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances as he does others; but the very foundation and root of their diſcouragement is their doubtings of the truth of the Goſpel: for we may obſerve that men under diſcouragement are ſtill harping upon the greatneſs of their provocations, and their unworthy carriages; they run in a legal ſtrain, they are ſtill inſiſting on the multitude and aggravations of their ſins: had men but a ſpirit of Faith prevailing in them, theſe would be humbling things but not diſcouraging: men would not ſo harp on this thing but would ſee enough in Chriſt to quiet their hearts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.16, 45 <hi>Iſai.</hi> 24. and accordingly it is obſervable that when a Saint is under greateſt diſcouragements, if God does but open his eyes to ſee indeed this way of Salvation by Chriſt, he will no longer ſtand inſiſting upon his fears but with comfort and joy, roll himſelf on Chriſt: the inward diſcoveries of the Goſpel make his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations vaniſh; yea, he does not only rejoyce in Chriſt but can ſometimes diſcern that ſincerity which he was ſo doubtful of before; indeed the doubting of the Goſpel does not only make the hearts of men fail, when they are fearful of their ſincerity, but it has often alſo a conſiderable influence into thoſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings about ſincerity, and hinder men from ſeeing thoſe evidences that are diſcernable of their upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: by all which it does appear, that it is a matter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:192038:11"/>of ſolemn care that ſinners be convinced and aſſured of the truth of this Doctrine, that it is ſafe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: and that Saints al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be further convinced, that they may grow up <hi>to all the riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding to the acknowledgment of the myſtery of God, even of the Father and of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,</hi> Col. 2.2. which is the deſign of this preſent Treatiſe.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>To make the way to the Subject propoſed more plain, I ſhall premiſe two things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is a poſſibility of the Salvation of Sinners; for a ſinner when his Conſcience is awakened lies open to that temptation among others, that it is impoſſible for ſuch an one as he to be ſaved: and theſe fears ariſe upon a double account; the firſt is, he fears it is beyond the mercy of God to pardon him: his ſins are ſo great that they have turned away the heart of God from him, that God cannot find in his heart to pity and pardon ſuch a ſinner as he is: man is very prone to limit the mercy of God, and entertain low and diſhonourable thoughts of his grace, eſpecially when under a ſenſe of his anger: but ſuch an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as this is altogether groundleſs, what his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful purpoſes are towards this or that particular man
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:192038:12"/>is beyond us to determine, till he makes it known: but no man has cauſe to queſtion the ſufficiency of Gods mercy, in order to his pardon and ſalvation: there is an infinite Ocean of mercy in his heart ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for all ſinners: To clear up this, I ſhall ſhew firſt, wherein the merciful nature of God does conſiſt, and then ſhew you the greatneſs of it:</p>
               <p>For the firſt: The merciful nature of God is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfection, whereby he can find in his heart to ſhew mercy if he pleaſes: a merciful nature in man is a bent and inclination of heart unto the exerciſes of mercy: the heart of man is biaſſed, ſet and bent that way; but we muſt not conceive this of God: the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful purpoſes of God were the free actings of his own will: God was an abſolute free Agent either to beſtow mercy or deny it as he pleaſed; if he had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally an inclination to ſhew mercy, he could not have forborn to ſhew mercy without going contrary to the inclination of his own heart: the exerciſe of mercy does not flow neceſſarily from the merciful nature of God: but he exerciſes grace freely from His Sovereign Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l and Pleaſure: there is nothing in Gods nature that does compel him to ſhew mercy to any man: God had been infinite in mercy if it had pleaſed him never to exerciſe any: there are voluntary inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in God to exerciſe mercy, but no natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but his merciful nature is that whereby he can find in his heart to exerciſe mercy: God is not of ſuch a nature as to be uncapable of pitying and being kind: there is no oppoſition in the nature of God unto acts of mercy: his nature is ſuch as that he can be willing to ſhew kindneſs and do good: the merciful nature of God is a power to be willing to deal graciouſly with with his creatures, God is of ſuch a nature, as that he can be willing to do good to thoſe that are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:192038:12"/>unworthy, willing to pardon thoſe that are guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is called his merciful nature: the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſerve to clear up this, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.17, 18, 19. <hi>Let the power of my Lord be great according as thou haſt ſpoken,</hi> ſaying, <hi>the Lord is long ſuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don I beſeech thee the iniquity of this people, according to the greatneſs of thy mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the greatneſs of Gods mercy, or merciful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſiſts in this, that he can find in his heart to do any thing that is an act of mercy: his merciful nature reacheth to every thing that is an object of mercy; there is nothing which it would be an act of grace or mercy to do, be it never ſuch wonderful grace, but God can find in his heart to do it; 'tis true, he can't pardon ſin in a way contrary unto Juſtice; for that would not be an act of grace, but of injuſtice: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is an act of grace does exceed the grace of <hi>God:</hi> and herein lies the greatneſs of his mercy; the greatneſs of <hi>Gods</hi> power lies in this, that he can do whatever is poſſible; whatever is an act of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo the greatneſs of his Wiſdom lies in this, that it extends it ſelf to every thing that is known: the greatneſs of his Juſtice lies in this, that he can find in his heart to do every thing that is an act of Juſtice: ſo the greatneſs of his grace conſiſts in this, that there is no gracious act, but it falls within the reach of his gracious nature: and herein the grace of God doth exceed the grace of any man or angel; is it an act of grace to ſend a Mediator for loſt Sinners, to bring worthleſs man to eternal glory; to pardon multitudes of ſins, ſins againſt light, love, covenant, to convert all a mans children? theſe and whatever
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:192038:13"/>elſe of the like nature may be thought on, fall within the reach of divine mercy; yea, the reaſon why he does not pardon the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, the ſins of devils and reprobates, is not for want of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but becauſe of the ſoveraign determinations of his own will: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15.</p>
               <p>That God is thus great in mercy, may be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from thoſe two conſiderations:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there is no corruption in God to make him uncapable of performing any act of grace: men can't find in their hearts ſometimes to do acts of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, becauſe their luſts are too ſtrong for them: it will not ſuffer them: their corruptions bear ſuch ſway, that they cannot be willing: ſometimes mens covetouſneſs is ſuch, that they cannot ſhew acts of mercy; ſo it was with <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. ſometimes pride and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo prevail, that they cannot forget an injury: they have a ſpirit of reverge, and cannot ſatisfie their hearts, without avenging themſelves: but God is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether free from corruption, there is no evil diſpoſition in him to hinder him from doing good: <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11: he has no evil properties to be an impediment unto him: men are ill conditioned, which makes them unwilling to do good: but God is of unſported purity and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.3. God is not ſubject to any wrongful paſſions: the Scripture does often attribute anger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but that muſt be underſtood ſo as is agreeable unto the nature of God: whatever injuries God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, he never is tranſported with paſſion; he can overlook millions of offences: his grace is ſuch as can prevail over all our guilt: hence his grace is ſaid to reign, it overcome all thoſe objections that are in the way of the exerciſe of it: <hi>Rom</hi> 5.21. there is nothing of any unruly paſſions in God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8. God is not ſubject unto envy: he can find in his heart to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance

               <p>By this we have gained one ſtep, namely, that the grace of God does exceed the grace that is in ſinful man: which may be of advantage to us, for there is that vanity in the heart, that we are prone to meaſure the mercy of God by our own: and to allow him no more grace than we find in our ſelves, and others like our ſelves: which God witneſſes againſt when he tells us, <hi>That his thoughts are not as</hi> our <hi>thoughts, Iſai.</hi> 55.8. but there is a further conſideration that will make it appear, that the Grace of God does exceed the grace of the moſt glorious angel in heaven: which is the unlimited perfection of Gods nature: the <hi>Angels</hi> have a ſtinted meaſure of perfection: the excelling of their nature is not ſufficient in order to ſome acts of grace: as in other reſpects, they are not ſufficient, ſo they have not grace enough to pardon ſuch wrongs as God pardons; to be at ſuch coſt for mans ſalvation, as God has been at: 'tis true that they do approve of and rejoice in all thoſe acts of Grace that God does: but ſuch actions do exceed the grace that is in their hearts; they have ſuch imperfection of grace and mercy, that they can't perform thoſe acts of mercy, that God does: therefore where God would ſhew his ſufficiency to pardon the iniquities of his people, he tells them, that he is <hi>God, Hoſ.</hi> 11.6. this infiniteneſs of Gods grace is the foundation of our faith, for ſuch things as we are utterly unworthy of: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.7. <hi>how excellent is thy loving kindneſs O Lord, therefore the Sons of men put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:192038:14"/>wings.</hi> There is an infinite Ocean of grace in the heart of God, whereby he can beſtow the greateſt gifts upon his creatures, that their natures are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of: this is plain from that abſolute liberty which the Scripture does aſcribe unto God in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>he does all things after the counſel of his own Will,</hi> Eph. 1.11. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Rom</hi> 9.15. which ſhews there is no limitedneſs in his perfection, to be any reſtraint unto him: or a reaſon why he does not pardon and ſave theſe and thoſe: his glorious excellency is ſuch, that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, nor provocation can overcome his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: but there is a ſufficiency of grace in him, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that is an act of mercy.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing that makes awakened ſinners fear, that there is an impoſſibility of their ſalvation, is an apprehenſion that it is contrary to the Juſtice of God: and not reconcilable with the ſentence of the Law: God ſtands bound in faithfulneſs, to ſee the Law made good: and they are to ſeek about the conſiſtency of the Law and Goſpel: the clearing up of which difficulty, I ſhall refer unto the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: at preſent it may ſuffice: to ſay that God in his Word declares it to be conſiſtent with his Juſtice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. <hi>that he may be juſt, and the Juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus:</hi> it is a great help unto conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſee how the Juſtice of <hi>God,</hi> and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law is preſerved in the Juſtification of ſinners: but where the manner of it is not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, conſcience has matter of ſatisfaction, in that <hi>God</hi> teſtifies, that it is ſo:</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be premiſed is, What we are to underſtand by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and that which is intended hereby, is the whole courſe of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:192038:14"/>the Obedience and Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt: by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt we are to underſtand that which he performed as a ſurety: his mediatorly Righteouſneſs: this Righteouſneſs is ſpoken of, <hi>John</hi> 16.10. <hi>Of Righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to my Father, Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>by the Righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all, to the juſtification of life, Dan.</hi> 4.24. <hi>to bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs:</hi> upon this account it is, that he is ſaid to be <hi>made for Righteouſneſs to us,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>to be the Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23.65. this is ſometimes called <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God, Rom.</hi> 10: 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. either becauſe Chriſt who wrought it out for us, is God as well as Man: or becauſe it is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of <hi>Gods</hi> providing: in diſtinction from a Righteoufneſs of our own working out: ſometimes it is called the <hi>Righteouſneſs which is by Faith, Heb</hi> 11 7 becauſe Faith is the condition whereby we come to be interreſted in it: ſometimes they are joined together: and it is called <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God which is by Faith, Rom.</hi> 3.22 <hi>Phil</hi> 3 9.</p>
               <p>That this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt doth not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his active obedience, but likewiſe his ſufferings: is manifeſt from hence, becauſe the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is that whereby we are juſtified: it is by that that we come to be righteous in the ſight of God, <hi>Rom</hi> 5 18 and not only this active obedience of Chriſt has an influence into our Juſtification, but his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings alſo: the Apoſtle does once ſeem to attribute it to his Obedience, <hi>Rom</hi> 5 19 <hi>by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous:</hi> but this don't exclude the ſufferings of Chriſt from having a part in our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. Obedience may comprehend his ſuffering for in them he was obedient; or elſe when it is ſaid, that by his Obedience we are made righteous, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:192038:15"/>part of Juſtification may be underſtood, which does conſiſt in giving a title unto heaven, there are two parts of Juſtification, one is abſolution from guilt, the other is declaring men heirs of life: this latter may be intended, which is the fruit of the active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Jeſus Chriſt; or elſe by Obedience, as one principal part of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, the whole may be intended: as when we are ſaid to be juſtified by his blood, his active obedience is not excluded; but the ſufferings of Chriſt have an influence into our juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, as well as his Obedience; for we were in ſuch a ſtate, that active obedience alone was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for our Juſtification; when man was in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, he needed only active obedience, for his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but man fallen, needed more for his juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than Obedience; he needed ſatisfaction, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to pacifie the provoked anger of God, no meer Obedience would make a recompence for ſins; for the Law threatned death for them; the holy life of Chriſt could not ſatisfie for ſin; it was ſomething of another kind that the Law required; namely, the ſufferings of death; and the Scripture doth abundantly witneſs unto the influence of Chriſts Sufferings into our juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; we are <hi>juſtified by his blood, Rom</hi> 5 4 ſo we are ſaid to be redeemed, cleanſed from ſin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to <hi>God</hi> to have our ſins purged with his blood which was typified by the ſacrifice under the Law; ſo that the Sufferings of Chriſt are intended as well as his active obedience by his Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called a part of his Righteouſneſs; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in them he did fulfil the command of God, and that duty that lay upon him as our ſurety, that was one of the things he undertook as our Mediator, to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:192038:15"/>redeem us from the curſe, being made a curſe for us: as it was his duty to fulfil the precepts of the Law for us, ſo likewiſe to bear the penalty of the Law; if he had failed in that he had not anſwered his Office obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations: he ſtood bound to God to undergo the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſins, God expected that from him <hi>to make his Soul an Offering for ſin, Iſa.</hi> 53, 10. and he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a command to lay down his life, as the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, he was equal to the Father, but as Mediator he was commanded by him, John 10.18. <hi>I lay it down of my ſelf, I have power to lay it down, and power to take it again, and this Commandment have I received of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſulfilled the Law of the Mediator in his ſufferings; and therefore he is ſaid <hi>to be obedient unto death, the death of the Croſs, Phil.</hi> 2 8. the ſame is implyed in that expreſſion, <hi>he learned obedience by the things that be ſuffered, Heb</hi> 5.8. the meaning is not that he learned to obey, but he Learned by the ſufferings; what a difficult thing Obedience was: it was a part of his Obedience to ſuffer, and ſo may be called his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſo indeed there is righteouſneſs in thoſe ſufferings of the Saints, which in a way of holineſs, they do expoſe themſelves unto: and thoſe ſufferings of Chriſt may be called his righteouſneſs: partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by them he became legally righteous: the ſins of the Elect were imputed unto him, and he was legally guilty: he ſtood bound to anſwer for the ſins of his people: and accordingly was apprehended by the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, and the puniſhment of the Law inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon him, by bearing of which he has paid the debt, and the Law has no more power over him: by his ſufferings he is become righteous in Law, and diſcharged from any more ſufferings for ever, having ſuffered the puniſhment of our ſins, the Law has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted him, has nothing at all to object againſt him,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:192038:16"/>he has anſwered the Law, and now is reputed legally righteous: hence it is that preſently upon his ſuffering he is ſaid to be juſtified: <hi>juſtified in his Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 13 16 that is by his Reſurrection unto life, by his ſufferings he has delivered himſelf from that guilt that lay upon him: and is become in the eye of the Law righteous.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Propoſition, That it is a ſafe thing to appear in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg, I.</hi> Becauſe Chriſts Righteouſneſs is the Righteouſneſs of the Law.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Subject of the preſent diſcourſe is, That it is a ſafe thing to appear in the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; it is ſafe to go before the Judgment Seat of God, having no other righteouſneſs to plead for our Juſtification, but Chriſts Righteouſneſs, this Righteouſneſs is ſufficient and will prevail for the ſalvation of all thoſe that have an intereſt in it; we may with quietneſs depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as that which will ſerve our turn: there is no other Righteouſneſs that can be come at, that it is ſafe appearing in: our own perſonal righteouſneſs is many ways defective and uncapable of being the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Juſtification: that Righteonſneſs that is performed by the Saints is acceptable unto God:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:192038:17"/>but it can't procure the acceptance of their perſons; the acceptance of it ſelf is procured by Chriſt; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. but we may juſtly venture our ſelves upon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt; other foundations will prove ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is a firm founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for faith: and therefore it was <hi>Pauls</hi> great care that he might <hi>be found not in his own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p>The Truth of which Propoſition, I ſhall demonſtrate by the following Arguments.</p>
               <div n="1" type="argument">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Arg. I.</hi> The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the Law required of us: it anſwers the demand that the Law makes of us, and therefore it is ſafe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it.</head>
                  <p>There is a neceſſity of our having the righteouſneſs of the Law: God has ſtated the Law to be a rule of his proceeding towards man: wherein he has ſet down the terms upon which he will beſtow life and execute death; in that Covenant, he gave not onely a Law unto man, but likewiſe to himſelf, from which he will never ſwerve. O it is utterly vain for any man to expect acceptance with God without that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which the Law requires; until the Law be anſwered, man can lay no claim to bleſſedneſs: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can God in faithfulneſs beſtow bleſſedneſs upon man: God has bound himſelf to ſee the Law fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a tittle: this Law can't be abrogated nor diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled: Saints indeed are not under the condemning power of it; becauſe it has been fulfilled for them: but yet the Law ſtands in fotce; as a rule according to which God will diſtribute eternal rewards, Math
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192038:17"/>5.18. <hi>One jot, or one tittle of the Law ſhall in no wiſe paſs, till all be fulfilled:</hi> man may break the Law, but God will fulfil it; the Law is never out of date, and as it cannot be abrogated, ſo neither can it be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: God will never take up with leſs ſatisfaction then the Law admits of, nor with a leſs perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience then the Law requires: God does under the Goſpel, accept of imperfect Obedience; but not for Juſtification. There can be no varying from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and higheſt demands of the Law: the Law is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, and muſt be exactly attended: it abates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: ſo that a regular conſcience can never give peace until the Law be fully anſwered: the Law gives ſin a condemning power, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.56. <hi>the ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> the Law muſt be anſwered.</p>
                  <p>And it is ſufficient for us if we have the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law; there is no danger of our miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if we have that righteouſneſs: the ſincerity of the angels in heaven is, that they have the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law: and that is a ſufficient ſincerity, for us if we have the righteouſneſs of the Law: if we have the righteouſneſs of the Law, then we are not liable to the curſe of the Law, we are not threatned by the Law, Juſtice is not provoked with us; the condemnation of the Law can take no hold upon us: the Law has nothing to object againſt our ſalvation: that ſoul that has the righteouſneſs of the Law, is out of the reach of the threatnings of the law, where the demand of the Law is anſwered, the Law finds no fault; the Law curſes only for want of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. yea moreover where there is the righteouſneſs of the Law, God has bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to give eternal life; ſuch perſons are heirs of life,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:192038:18"/>according to the promiſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> the law declares them heirs of life, Gal. 3.12. <hi>the man that doth them, ſhall live in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which the Law requireth of us, is clearly held out in the Word of God: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. where the Apoſtle ſets down the end of Gods ſending his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemning ſin in the fleſh; which is, that <hi>the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us:</hi> the meaning of it muſt needs be, that we might be made righteous by the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts righteouſneſs: this righteouſneſs is ſaid to be fulfilled in us, in as much as we have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it in our ſurety, ſo Rom. 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth:</hi> the end of giving <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, was to drive us to Chriſt, in whom alone we have the righteouſneſs of the Law: this is alſo clearly held out in all ſuch Scriptures where Chriſt is ſaid to be our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that we be made righteous by his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for righteouſneſs conſiſts in anſwering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law; it is only that righteouſneſs that the Law demands of us, that can denominate us le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally righteous: if Chriſts Righteouſneſs were not that which the Law requires of us, we could not be accepted as righteous upon that account: and the Scripture ſpeaks particularly of Chriſts ſufferings, that they were thoſe which the Law required of us, Gal. 3.8. <hi>Chriſt has redeemed us from the curſe of the Law being made a curſe for us;</hi> that curſe that he redeemed us from, is that he endured; and that was the curſe of the Law; and indeed herein lies the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chriſts righteouſneſs, where by it is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſo much comfort and ſupport unto Saints,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:192038:18"/>that it is that righteouſneſs that the law requires of us: this is that conſideration from which conſcience does take ſatitfaction.</p>
                  <p>But there lies one great objection againſt this, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to make an oppoſition between the righteouſneſs of the law, and the righteouſneſs of faith, and between juſtification by the law, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by grace, and by faith, and by the promiſe: ſo <hi>a man is not juſtified by the law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt. Gal.</hi> 2.6, <hi>received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith, Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>the law is not of faith, Gal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>if the inheritance be of the law, it is no mere of promiſe, gal.</hi> 3.5, 18. <hi>if there had been given a law, that could have given life, verily righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhould have been by the law, Gal.</hi> 3:21. <hi>that I may be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt: the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith, Phil:</hi> 3:9: <hi>by the deeds of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight, but now the righteouſneſs of God without the law is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, Rom:</hi> 3:20, 31: <hi>we conclude that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the law, Rom</hi> 3.28. <hi>if they that are of the law he heirs, faith is made void, Rom:</hi> 4:14: <hi>if by grace, it is no more of works, Rom:</hi> 11: 6: by theſe places it ſeems there is no need of having the righteouſneſs of the law in order to our juſtification.</p>
                  <p>The reſolution of this doubt does depend upon the right underſtanding of what is meant by the law, and by the works of the law; by the law he intends a meer covenant of works, abſtracted from that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of accompliſhing of it, which God has revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Goſpel, and thus the law is utterly uncapable of juſtifying of us, <hi>it is weak through the fleſh, Rom:</hi> 8.3: and the way of life by the law, is diſtinguiſhed from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:192038:19"/>that way by faith; for though the covenant of works leaves room for ſalvation by Chriſt, and does no way forbid ſuch a way of ſalvation: yet it provides no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for fallen man; yea is utterly ſilent as to a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for him: leaves ſinful man in a periſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; denouncing the curſe againſt him, ſhews him no way of ſalvation: tells him not of any poſſibility of ſalvation: the covenant of works made no proviſion for ſalvation, but it gave way to mans ſalvation, in caſe the righteouſneſs of it were fulfilled by a ſurety: ſo that the way of life by the law and by the Goſpel, are divers ways, but not oppoſite; the covenant of grace ſuppoſes a covenant of works, and finds out a new way of fulfilling it; yet the practiſe of thoſe who ſought Juſtification by the covenant of works alone, was contrary to the doctrine of grace, <hi>whoſoever is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the Law,</hi> that is, ſeeks to be juſtified on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits that he is juſtified by the law, is <hi>fallen from grace, Gal</hi> 4: 5. the Law and Goſpel are indeed by God in a glorious ſubordination one to the other: but men by ſeeking to be juſtified by the covenant of works alone, do ſet one in oppoſition to the other.</p>
                  <p>By the works of the law the Apoſtle underſtands, ſuch works as men themſelves do perform in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the law, this is evident, becauſe he calls them <hi>his own righteouſneſs which is of the Law, Phil.</hi> 3.9. and theſe works are utterly uncapable of juſtifying us: though Chriſts works according to the law, are the matter of our juſtification, <hi>Rom:</hi> 5.19. but our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal conformity to the law being attended with ſo much imperfection, can't juſtifie us: we muſt ſeek our juſtification by the righteouſneſs that the law requires: but not by our own works according to the law; <hi>Iſrael</hi> is not blamed <hi>for ſeeking after the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that is the righteouſneſs of the law; but becauſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:192038:19"/>they ſought it <hi>as it were by the works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9.31, 32.</p>
                  <p>For the fuller clearing up of this Truth, that Chriſt has performed the Righteouſneſs that the Law required of us, whereupon the ſatisfaction of our Conſciences does ſo much depend: I ſhall briefly ſpeak to theſe Particulars;

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:192038:22"/>I know it is anſwered, that ſin deſerves evil at Gods hands, but holineſs which is due unto God, does not deſerve any rewards; but this does not take off the force of the argument: for it is by the Law that ſin merits as well as holineſs; and hence wicked men are puniſhed only for ſuch ſins as they commit in this life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. and there is as much goodneſs in holineſs, as evil in ſin; and it is a meet thing that God ſhould beſtow as much good in a way of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as he inflicts evil in a way of diſobedience: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Law expreſſes the puniſhment of ſin by death Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death;</hi> and the reward of obedience by life.

                     <p>The ſecond thing that falls under Conſideration here is;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What is the difference between the Covenant of works and the Covenant with</hi> Adam?</p>
                     <p>Gods covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> is generally confounded with the covenant of works, to the great hindrance of our underſtanding of Gods dealings with Man-kind: <hi>Adam</hi> indeed was made as well as we under a covenant of works; under a covenant of life, upon condition of perfect obedience: but beſides this there was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby he was conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a legal head, or repreſentative of his poſterity, to act in our behalf: to ſtand or fall for us, as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: this is plainly held forth in that he is ſaid <hi>to be the figure of him that is to come,</hi> that is of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. he was the figure of Chriſt, inaſmuch as he was made a publick perſon, as Chriſt alſo was; this alſo is evident becauſe we ſinned in him: his fall is truly ours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. which could not have been if we had not been in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:192038:23"/>him as our repreſentative: becauſe God had conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him our head, therefore his ſin became ours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22.</p>
                     <p>There is a great difference between theſe two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, there might have been a covenant of works, though there never had been any ſuch covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> conſtituting him a publick perſon: that was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental to the covenant of works: God made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works with the Angels, but he never appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them any publick perſon to act for them: but every one ſtood ſingly for himſelf: we make a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them in theſe three particulars:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Covenant of <hi>Adam</hi> propoſed a particular way for the accompliſhment of the covenant of works: the covenant of works ſtates the condition of life: but God by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aking <hi>Adam</hi> a publick perſon finds out a way for the fulfilling of this condition: God has propoſed two wayes for the accompliſhing of the covenant of works:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> By making a covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> to perform obedience for his poſterity: this way ſailed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> was, By making a covenant of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption with Jeſus Chriſt; wherein Chriſt undertook to fulfil the covenant of works for us: this I call the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond way, becauſe tho this covenant was made firſt, yet it was revealed laſt, as not to take place until the covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> was violated.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> has never been fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but the covenant of works has; <hi>Adam</hi> utterly ſailed of performing that particular covenant made with him: if that covenant had been fulfilled all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had been happy: whereas they were all expoſed to miſery by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. but the covenant of works
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:192038:23"/>has been fulfilled; Chriſt fulfilled it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.15. and we in him, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.4.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By vertue of <hi>Adams</hi> covenant we are only liable to puniſhment for that ſin, which we committed in him: for that covenant only laid duty on him, as he was to act joyntly for himſelf and us: and that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was at an end on his eating the forbidden fruit: but by the covenant of works we are liable to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our perſonal ſins: that covenant threatens death for any tranſgreſſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                     <p>A Third thing to be conſidered is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Covenant of Works did admit of a Mediator.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will be readily granted, that though the evil of ſin be incomparably great, yet it is not ſo great but that God may have compaſſion upon us, and find in his heart to provide a Mediator for us, his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may move him to give us a Redeemer, though ſin do greatly provoke him: The great queſtion is, Whether he has not ſo bound himſelf by his lavv; as to take away all poſſibility of help by a Mediator. Whether the Law will give way to the interpoſure of a Mediator. Whether the Word of God does not bind him to puniſh the ſinner in his own perſon; if ſo, it is a vain thing to expect any help from a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for no violence may be done unto the law: and the words of the curſe have ſuch a force, as if they did devote the ſinner unto perſonal ruine: <hi>in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely dye, Gen</hi> 2 17. but we muſt diſtinguiſh between ſuch threatnings as are legal, and ſuch as are perſonal: ſome threatnings are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, and infallibly to be fulfilled upon theſe that are threatned: though the threatnings of eternal
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:192038:24"/>deſtruction againſt impenitent ſinners, muſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably take place on them: but there are ſome threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings which are legal: and intend no more, but that the Offender muſt dye legally; that is be puniſhed with death, either in his own perſon, or the perſon of his ſurety; thus many humane laws are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, thus it is among men in caſe of debt: and there is nothing in the words of the law that does contradict this interpretaiton. The words do enforce no more than this: the words of the law are not any ways ſtrained by putting this ſence upon them: neither is there any thing in the caſe of it ſelf to oppoſe this interpretation, for the fuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of a furety anſwer the end of the Law, as well as the ſufferings of the Offenders,</p>
                     <p>Gods name is as much vindicated, and there is as full a teſtimony given to the holineſs of God by the ſufferings of a ſurety, as if the ſinner had ſuffered in his own perſon, there is no probability that <hi>Adam</hi> did at firſt underſtand this interpretation of the cnrſe, it was a ſecret that God kept in his own breaſt, until there was occaſion for its publication; indeed from the firſt publiſhing of the Law, God ſhewed that a publick perſon might perform the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive part of it for others: and by failing therein, might expoſe others with himſelf unto ruine as <hi>Adam</hi> did. Which ſhews it alſo to be very fair, that a publick perſon may ſuffer for us: if a publick perſon may ruine us, why may not a publick perſon recover us: but we have no grounds to conclude that <hi>Adam</hi> knew any thing of the poſſibility of ſalvation in caſe he ſinned, but God after the Fall revealed it unto him.</p>
                     <p>But God has by his practice, clearly given us
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:192038:24"/>this interpretation of the curſe of the Law; God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has provided a Mediator for us, and inflicted the puniſhment of our ſins on him: which ſhews it is no ways contradictory to his law ſo to do: ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is agreeable to the law, otherwiſe Go? would never have had an hand in it; God has ſhewed us how the law is to be underſtood in executing it on Jeſus Chriſt, and it is very unreaſonable to think, that there ſhould be any thing in the law to hinder our ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt; for this way of ſalvation has been decreed by God before the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. <hi>he was foreordained before the foundation of the world;</hi> and certainly he would never make ſuch a law as ſhould overthrow his decree: the law muſt be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as not to croſs his everlaſting purpoſes of ſaving ſinners by Chriſt; the Apoſtle argues, that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace could not be diſanulled by the law of <hi>Moſes, which was given four hundred and thirty years after, Gal.</hi> 3.17. ſo I may argue, that the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purpoſe of God to ſave us by the ſufferings of Chriſt, cannot be diſanulled by a law that was made in time, and therefore that law muſt be ſo underſtood, as not to croſs that deſign.</p>
                     <p>The fourth thing to be cleared is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is a Mediator:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though the law left room for a Mediator, yet God was at liberty whether he would provide one or no: but he has provided Chriſt, and put him into this Office. Chriſt ſtands in that relation of a Mediator, and this implies both duty and authority, to work out all our ſalvation for us, both as to the purchaſing and alſo the applying of ſalvation: That Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is a Mediator, is ſet down in expreſs terms: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one Mediator between God and man,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:192038:25"/>the Man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is peculiar to the holy Scripture: <hi>Socinus</hi> would have it to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie only Gods Interpreter, and it may be that may be the meaning, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>it was ordained by angels in the hand of a Mediator:</hi> but the word generally notes one that ſtands between God and man, to make up the breach that ſin had made; that this is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the forementioned place, is evident by the next words, <hi>ver.</hi> 6 <hi>who gave himſelf a ranſome for all:</hi> ſo that his mediation conſiſted in giving himſelf a ranſom: or at leaſt he was ſuch a Mediator as did give himſelf a ranſom; this muſt alſo be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>and for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, that by means of his death for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament: they which are ealled may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promiſe of the eternal inheritance.</hi> There is plainly held forth that he executed his Mediatorly Office, in dying for tranſgreſſion; and in order to our injoying an eternal inheritance. The ſame Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torly Office of Chriſt is held forth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5, 6. <hi>for though there be that are called Gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be Gods many and Lords many) but to us there is but one God, the Father of whom are all things, and we in him, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi> The Heathens did diſtinguiſh between their Gods into celeſtial and terreſtial; the celeſtial and ſoveraign Gods, they thought to be immortal, of a ſublime and pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the terreſtial were the Deified ſouls of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men deceaſed, whoſe Office it was to be as Mediators and Agents between the ſoveraign Gods, and mortal men: theſe they called <hi>Baalims</hi> or <hi>Lords:</hi> unto theſe ſuperior and inferior Gods h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:192038:25"/>forth in thoſe titles of <hi>Prophet, Prieſt, and King,</hi> which are frequently given unto him, and contain under them the ſeveral parts of his Mediatorly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                     <p>There are three things requiſite unto the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torly Office of Chriſt, the fitneſs of his perſon, the conſent of the Father, and his own conſent:</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing requiſite, was the fitneſs of his perſon, whereby he was capable of diſcharging this Office: it did not become infinite Wiſdom to lay ſuch a task on one that was uncapable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and this requiſite was found in Jeſus Chriſt: this undertaking was too great for any meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it was not too heavy a burden for the ſhoulders of Jeſus Chriſt: he was fit to purchaſe our ſalvation, and alſo to apply it: and upon this account he was much prized by God, he is ſaid to be <hi>Elect and Precious,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. as a Prince prizes ſome men, becauſe they are of ſuch abilities, that they are fit to ſerve him in the greateſt Offices of the Kingdom, ſo God having a deſign to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he prizes Chriſt as a perſon fit to bring about that deſign.</p>
                     <p>The principal fitneſs of Jeſus Chriſt for the work of Mediator, conſiſts in his being God man in our perſon, yet we muſt not think that he did not enter into his Office, till he was actually incarnate: the incarnation was neceſſary to his full diſcharge of that work, but he entred into his Office, and began to fulfil it before his incarnation: our ſins were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually imputed to him, till his incarnation: but he was a Mediator immediately upon the fall of man: from that time his blood was efficacious, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. <hi>He is the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world;</hi>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:192038:26"/>from the time of the making of the covenant of grace, he was a Mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. and the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Patriarks</hi> in the firſt ages of the world, was the fruit of the mediation of Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſolemn conſecration of Chriſt at the time of his Baptiſm was not unto the Office of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but the work of his publick Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt by being man, was fitted as for ſome other parts of his Office, ſo eſpecially to fulfil the law for man: to obey and ſuffer for us, had he been only God he had been uncapable of obedience or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; had he taken upon him the nature of angels, he had been uncapable of obeying and ſuffering for us: the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law concerning the right of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, in the kinſman, did typifie that Chriſt ſhould be our kinſman; this manifeſted what God intended: but that doth not prove that there was a neceſſity of it; but if he had aſſumed the angelical nature, he could not have fulfilled that law that was given to man: the precepts and curſes of the law were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to mans nature, and ſome of them could not be fulfilled By the angelical nature; beſides the teuour of the covenant of works with man ran thus: that man muſt fulfil the righteouſneſs of the law, and in caſe of diſobedience, man muſt bear the curſe of it: this the Apoſtle ſhews when he teaches us <hi>that becauſe we did partake of fleſh and blood, Chriſt alſo partook of the ſame. that by death he might deliver us, Heb.</hi> 2.14. and intimates, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. that if he had taken the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of angels, it would not have ſerved the turn: and whereas he adds that he took on him <hi>the ſeed of Abraham;</hi> we are not to underſtand, that there was any neceſſity of that any further than from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and propheſies thereof, that he ſhould come of that ſtock; but he mentions his coming of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:192038:26"/>as that which evidenced that he was of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with us:</p>
                     <p>Chriſt by being God was fitted not only for his Prophetical and Kingly Office, to the execution whereof, Divine Power and Wiſdom was requiſite: but he was alſo fitted for his Prieſtly Office; ſo that the divine nature had an influence into the ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs of the ſufferings of Chriſt, that is held forth <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal ſpirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſciences from dead works,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To compleat the fitneſs of Jeſus Chriſt for the work of a Mediator, there were neceſſary ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial qualifications of the humane nature, eſpecially holineſs and wiſdom: his holineſs was neceſſary unto all his Offices: he would not have been fit to have executed his Prophetical Office without that; he had need be holy and faithful that is to declare the mind of God to man: without this he would not have him fit to have executed the Office of a King, he that rules the world, and judges mens eternal eſtate, had need be holy: without this he would not have been fit to have executed the Office of a Prieſt, he that was to work out righteouſneſs for others, and ſatisfie for their ſins, muſt be holy: and this qualification was perfect and compleat in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb,</hi> 7.26. <hi>For ſuch an High-prieſt became us, who is holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners.</hi> Here Chriſt's holineſs is ſet forth poſitiorly, he was holy, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively in three branches. He was harmleſs; free from actual ſin; undefiled: that is, free from origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pollution: ſeparate from ſinners, free from that common ſin of mankind, which they committed in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:192038:27"/>
                        <hi>Adam:</hi> the other qualification of wiſdom, was eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially neceſſary unto the execution of his Prophetical and Kingly Offices; this he needed an extraordinary meaſure of, and God has furniſhed him ſuitably, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.34. <hi>God giveth not the ſpirit by meaſure unto him:</hi> by which expreſſion we are not to underſtand infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite gifts, for the humane nature is not capable of an infinite qualification, but extraordinary qualifications, beyond what God does beſtow on other men: this was ſpoken concerning thoſe gifts, given him at the time of his Baptiſm, when the Spirit reſted on him; and queſtionleſs are far exceeded by thoſe gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him, when he Aſcended to the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of God.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond thing requiſite unto the Mediatorly Office of Chriſt, <hi>was the conſent of the Fathor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was a neceſſity of his approbation; that the Mediator might have authority to diſcharge his Office: there could be no redemption without the conſent of him, whoſe priſoners we are, and altho the ſufferings of Chriſt were in their own nature, a valuable conſideration for our redemption, yet there could not be ſatisfaction without the conſent of God. God might not be impoſed on, nor any ſatisfaction obtruded upon him without his conſent: the Office of a Mediator as it implies authority over man, ſo it implies ſubſection and ſubordination to God, and accordingly in this work Chriſt is <hi>Gods ſervant,</hi> Iſai 42.1. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold,</hi> and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture does give in abundant evidence, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did conſent to this undertaking of Chriſts: he is called Gods Elect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>mine Elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth;</hi> he was choſen by God to this work: ſo he is ſaid to be <hi>foreordained,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. Chriſt did not intrude into this Office, but was <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:192038:27"/>of God, Heb.</hi> 5.5, 6. when he came into the world be was ſent of <hi>God, John</hi> 5.37 he came with a commiſſion, and it was under Gods hand and ſeal, <hi>John</hi> 6.27. God has confirmed Chriſt in his Office be an Oath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever after the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melchizedek.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third thing requifite to the Mediatorly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, <hi>was his own conſent:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was not meet that ſuch an Office ſhould be forced upon him: that it ſhould be put upon him to dye for ſinners, without his own choice; and that if we conſider the innocency and excellency of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but he did freely conſent to take this task upon him: his will as he is God, is the ſame with the Fathers; and as man he cloſed with it, he voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertook this work of redeeming and ſaving ſinners: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.6. <hi>then ſaid I, lo I come in the volumn of the book, it is written of me, to do thy Will O God,</hi> Gal. 2 20. <hi>he loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> John 10.18. <hi>no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The conſent of the Father and the Son is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in Scripture, after the manner of a coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, called by Divines the covenant of redemption: in which tranſaction we may take notice of theſe five Articles.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Father promiſed to fit the son for the work of redemption, by preparing an humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ſo he might be capable of working out our redemption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <item>2. The Son covenanted to anſwer the law for us, that he would ſuffer for our ſins, and work out righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for us, <hi>Mat</hi> 20.28. <hi>The Son of man came to give his life for a ranſome for many,</hi> John 10.18. <hi>I have power to lay down my life, and power to take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and this Commandment have I received of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. The Father covenanted to accept the obedience and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt for the Elect, that their debt ſhould be remitted unto them, and they ſaved thereby, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.6. <hi>it is a light thing that thou ſhouldſt be my ſervant, to raiſe up the tribe of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael; I will alſo give thee to be a light unto the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the end of the earth,</hi> Iſa. 53.10.11, 12 <hi>when he ſhall make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. The Father covenanted to inveſt him with full authority to accompliſh the ſalvation of his redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones, and apply to them the benefits of his death: and in order to this, to advance his humane nature unto higheſt dignity and glory, <hi>John</hi> 17.2. <hi>thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he may give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him:</hi> Eph. 1.22. <hi>he hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be bead over all things to the Church.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>5. The Son covenanted fully to accompliſh the ſalvation of all the Elect, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. <hi>this is the will of the Father that ſent me, that of all that he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at

                     </list>
                     <p>The fifth Propoſition for the clearing this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſts work as Mediator, was not to reſtore Man to his former condition, but to bring him to Salvation:</hi> Our primitive eſtate in <hi>Adam</hi> was an eſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: we were habitually holy, without any offence, probationers for glory, neither in an eſtate of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor in an eſtate of juſtification: and God if he had ſo pleaſed might have appointed Chriſt to have reſtored us to our primitive condition; to have ſet us free from the guilt and power of ſin, and ſo might put us upon it to have wrought for our own bleſſedneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain according to the tenor of the former Covenant: but Chriſt was appointed to bring us into an eſtate of juſtification and ſalvation: Jeſus Chriſt had his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority beſtowed upon him to bring us to life: <hi>John</hi> 17.2. <hi>Thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him:</hi> accordingly Chriſt has done more for our bleſſedneſs than <hi>Adam</hi> was to do: <hi>Adam</hi> was to bring us out of an eſtate of innocency into an eſtate of juſtification: but Chriſt has brought us out of a guilty eſtate into an eſtate of juſtification: yea, Chriſt has done more for our bleſſedneſs than <hi>Adam</hi> did for our ruine: <hi>Adam</hi> brought us from innocency to miſery, but Chriſt has brought us from miſery not back again to innocency, but to bleſſedneſs: in this reſpect that Salvation that Chriſt has wrought is more eminent and remarkable than that deſtruction that <hi>Adam</hi> wrought: and for the pur chaſing of this, there was more required, than for the reſtitution of us to our primitive condition: the ſufferings of Chriſt were ſufficient to procure our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:192038:29"/>unto innocency: but there was a neceſſity of the active obedience of Jeſus Chriſt to bring us into an eſtate of bleſſedneſs: Chriſts active obedience was neceſſary for us as well as his paſſive, and this was one reaſon why it was requiſite that Chriſt ſhould continue ſo long upon earth, that by a courſe of obedience for many years he might purchaſe eternal life for us: the influence of the blood of Chriſt into our juſtification was typified by the Sacrifices, the influence of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive obedience of Chriſt into our juſtification was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by the white Garments of the Prieſts, and the beautiful Garments of the High Prieſt: our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is compared to the putting on <hi>of white Raiment, Rev.</hi> 3.18. ſome have objected againſt the neceſſity of Chriſts active obedience to our Juſtification; that by his ſufferings he ſatisfied for our ſins of omiſſion as well as of commiſſion; and if our ſins of omiſſion be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for it is all one as if we had performed the duty: but that is a miſtake, we can't he juſtified ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept obedience be performed: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>The man that doth them ſhall live in them;</hi> ſuffering is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the threatning, not of the command: meer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering has ſatisfaction but no merit in it: ſuffering for ſins of omiſſion only removes the guilt contracted by the omiſſion, ſuffering for ſins of omiſſion, puts us into ſuch a condition as if the duty had not been omitted: but not into ſuch a condition, as if it had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: into ſuch a condition as <hi>Adam</hi> was in; not ſuch as Believers are in: in a ſin of omiſſion there are two things to be obſerved; a neglect of duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, which is to be puniſhed; and a neglect of the condition of life; which condition muſt be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before life be beſtowed: the forgiving of an omiſſion may be, where the duty is ſtill expected: if a man fail of paying Money at the day, his omiſſion may be forgiven, and yet the money may be expected.</p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:192038:29"/>
                     <p>The ſixth Propoſition for the clearing of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt has fulfilled the righteouſneſs of the Law. He has anſwered all the demands and challenges of the Law: what the Law could chalenge from us has been accompliſhed by, and upon Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt has fulfilled Obedience unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law: Jeſus Chriſt lived a life of ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs holineſs and integrity: obedient in all things unto the command of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on Earth, I have finiſhed the work that thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.22. <hi>Who did no ſin, neither was guil found in his mouth:</hi> he lived in a perfect and abſolute conformity to the Law of God all the dayes of his life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid to <hi>know no ſin.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. concerning this active obedience of Chriſt, I ſhall here only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe two things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That he did all the common duties of the Law, and ſuch particular duties as were proper to the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he ſuſtained: he did not ſuſtain all relations, as that of Husband and Parents, and therefore the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties peculiar to ſuch relations were not requir'd of him nor performed by him: neither was there any need that he ſhould ſtand in all relations, and fulfil the work required of all: ſome give that reaſon why Chriſt was in this or that condition, that it was to ſanctifie thoſe conditions to his People, and by that reaſon he had need have been in all conditions, that the like might be ſanctified to his people: but it was ſufficient that Chriſt fulfilled the whole Law, as it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of one in his ſtation; and that is enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the Elect, whatever relation or condition they are in.</p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:192038:30"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt did obey not only moral commands, but alſo ſubjected himſelf to the commands of inſtituted Worſhip: and as he was circumciſed in his infancy, ſo when he was adult, he was Baptized, and gives that reaſon of it, becauſe <hi>it became him to fulfil all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Mat. 3.15. So Chriſt partook of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26 29. ſome think that the reaſon why Chriſt was Baptized, was that he might thereby ſhew his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm; but that might have been done by his Word; and I can't think that Chriſt would uſe a fignificant ceremony if the ſignification had not at all belonged to him: neither would he perform an act of Worſhip that was not proper for him, only to ſhew his approbation: another reaſon that is given, is, that it was to ſanctifie our Baptiſme, but their Baptiſm was ſanctified that were Baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: beſides it is not the example but the inſtitution of Chriſt that ſanctifies our Baptiſm: Another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that hereby he was inaugurated and conſecrated to his Office: but there is nothing leads to that, he was ſolemnly conſecrated immediately after; this Ordinance has no ſuch ſignification: but the reaſon of it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin was imputed to him, and as this Ordinance ſeals up to us deliverance from ſin through Chriſts Blood, ſo it ſealed up to him deliverance from the guilt of ſin through his <hi>own Blood:</hi> through the ſhedding of his <hi>Blood</hi> he was juſtified, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16 and this was a Seal to his Faith, and ſin imputed was Sacramentally done away hereby: the like may be ſaid of his parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus has likewiſe born the penalty of the Law: the death of Jeſus Chriſt was a legal death, it was the execution of the Law: the putting of Chriſt to death was an act of vindictive juſtice: it was a fruit of the wrath of God; this is evident, becauſe he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:192038:30"/>is ſaid to <hi>he made a curſe for us:</hi> the curſe is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſentence and execration of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, this the Apoſtle proves from <hi>Dout</hi> 21.22, 23. that law was a ceremonial Law, whereby they that were hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a Tree were ceremonially accurſed, to typifie the accurſed death of Jeſus Chriſt: this typical reaſon excepted, there is no reaſon why this ſort of death ſhould faſten a curſe on a perſon more than any other legal death: this Law makes the man that was hanged a ceremonial curſe to typifie Chriſts having the moral curſe: Again, it is clear, be cauſe God puniſhed Chriſt with death for ſin; and God does not puniſh ſin, but by the Law: the death of Chriſt was on the account of ſin, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58 6. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.3. <hi>Chriſt died for our ſins according to the Scriptures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Several things are here objected;</p>
                     <p>As 1. <hi>That Chriſt did not ſuffer ſpiritual death in ſin, the loſs of the image of God, which is a part of the penalty of the Law:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt bore the eſſential parts of the curſe, not all the accidental; there be many circumſtantial parts of the curſe wherein there may be great variety: ſo one Reprobate does not bear all the pains, diſeaſes and afflictions that others do: ſome Reprobates ſhall not endure bodily death, as they which are alive at the coming of Chriſt; ſo Chriſt did ſuffer ſome ſorrows that were peculiar, which indeed there was no abſolute neceſſity of from the moral Law: as he ſuffered a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal death from men, died as a Malefactor, with many aggravating circumſtances: there was no need that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer the ſame <hi>in ſpecie</hi> with reprobates, it was ſufficient that he ſuffered the ſame <hi>in pondere;</hi>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:192038:31"/>the death of the Soul in ſin flows not from the curſe abſolutely conſidered, but from the diſpoſition of the patient: it is a puniſhment fit for ſinners but not for a Mediator.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Obj. <hi>Chriſt did not ſuffer the torments of Hell, which are a principal part of the curſe:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> He did not ſuffer in Hell: but he ſuffered the ſame for ſubſtance with them that are there: as for the bodily puniſhments of Chriſt they were very great: but he bare the puniſhment of Hell in his ſoul: he bore the loſs of the comfortable fruition of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27 46. and he had the doleful ſenſe of the wrath of God on his heart: this is held out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.7. <hi>He ſhall drink of the brook in the way:</hi> and as we have peace of conſcience through imputed righteouſneſs, ſo he had torment of conſcience from imputed ſin: what was it elſe that he conflicted with in his agony; was it only the fears of temporal death, which many Martyrs have born with triumph; he grapled with the wrath of God, that made him ſweat drops of blood.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Obj. <hi>Chriſt did not ſuffer eternal death, and the eternity of the puniſhment is the great aggravation:</hi>

                        <item>2. The ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt were alſo upon our account, and indeed there can no other account be given of theſe ſufferings, no other reaſon, but this can be aſſigned of them: his ſufferings were excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great, as appears by his being afflicted before hand about it, by his heavineſs and amazement, by his prayer, by his ſweating drops of blood, and no ſatisfactory reaſon can be given of theſe ſufferings, but only that he bore our curſe: it was not for any perſonal ſin, for he had none, <hi>Heb,</hi> 7.26. it was not to prevent any ſin, God ſometimes Brings afflictions on his people to prevent their ſinning, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. but there was no danger of Chriſts ſinning: his nature was not tainted, and the union of the divine nature with the humane was a ſufficient ſecurity, it was not meerly in a way of trial, to try the patience and faith of Chriſt; the Scripture gives in no evidence of that: neither was it principally to give us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of patience; but he ſuffered to make an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us, and recencile us to God. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repreſents the ſufferings of Chriſt under a three ſold conſideration, all ſerving to clear up this point.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>A Second conſideration is of a ſacrifice: the ſins of the people were typically laid upon the ſacrifice, and then it was ſlain; ſo Chriſt was ſacrificed for us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5 2. <hi>Chriſt hath given himſelf for us, an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a ſacrifice to God of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour;</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7. <hi>Chriſt our Paſsover is ſacrificed for us:</hi> the fruit of this is Reconciliation.</p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:192038:32"/>
                     <p>A third conſideration of them, is, they are a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Jeſus Chriſt took upon the guilt of our ſins; that is, our obligation to puniſhment, the demerit of ſin, whereby the ſinner deſerves puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was not tranſlated to him, as the merit of his righteouſneſs is not tranſlated to us, but the title to bleſſedneſs ariſing there from: ſo Chriſt took upon himſelf our obligation to puniſhment, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly God inflicted the puniſhment of our ſins upon him: Chriſt was legally guilty of our ſin, and God puniſhed him, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.24 <hi>He bare our ſins in his own body upon the tree:</hi> ſai. 53.4. <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows:</hi> Rom 4.25. <hi>He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered for our offences?</hi> And here we may take notice of a great difference between the firſt and ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> brought the guilt of one ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, but Jeſus Chriſt takes away the guilt not only of that but of our innumerable perſonal Tranſgreſſions: and this the Apoſtle minds, <hi>Rom</hi> 5.16. <hi>And not as it was by one that ſinned, ſo is the gift, for the judgment was by one to condemnation: but the free gift is of many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences to juſtification:</hi> the firſt ſin that Man is guilty of layes him open unto death: and his after ſins do mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply his Obligations unto death, but do not expoſe him unto ſo many ſeveral deaths; yet they do expoſe him unto a ſorer and greater degree of eternal death: where there are ſeveral ſins meeting in the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are to be puniſhed with an aggravated death: one death muſt be endured equivalent to ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral deaths: for every ſin muſt be accounted for in the day of judgment, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.14. and therefore Chriſt that he might procure a remiſſion of all our ſins bore a puniſhment proportionable to them all: he was puniſhed for them all, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.5 <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions:</hi> what he redeemed us from that he endured himſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. only it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:192038:33"/>that by reaſon of the dignity of his perſon, that ſorrow which he endured, was a greater meaſure of puniſhment, that it would have been in us.</p>
                     <p>The Eighth thing to be conſidered, is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is ſufficient for the Elect of God in all ages:</hi> he has an everlaſting Prieſthood, and the vertue of his Sacrifice dos cotinue from the beginning to the end of the World: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid <hi>to bring in everlaſting Righteouſnes: Dan.</hi> 9.24.</p>
                     <p>His Righteouſneſs was efficacious for the ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming: though it was not then actually wrought out in former Generations, this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was available for juſtification: as a man may be diſcharged of a Debt becauſe of the Bond of his Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before the money is paid: ſo Chriſt was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the way of Salvation from the very fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> Gen. 3.15. <hi>The ſeed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head:</hi> the way that the <hi>Patriaks</hi> were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, was by Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. hence they are ſaid to be <hi>ſaved by Grace,</hi> Act: 15:11: the Covenant which was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was made in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Gal:</hi> 3:17: <hi>The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that was confirmed before by God in Chriſt:</hi> Chriſt was actually ſlain after the World had ſtood about four thouſand years: but he was reckoned as <hi>ſlain from the foundation of the World,</hi> Rev: 13:8: the vertue of his blood reached unto the firſt ages of the world: that is implied <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>Nor yet that he ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf often, as the High Prieſt entereth every year into the holy place with the blood of others, for then muſt be often have ſuffered ſince the foundation of the World; but now once in the end of the World hath he appeared to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:192038:33"/>put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf:</hi> Hence there was through him remiſſion of the ſins that were paſt, <hi>Rom:</hi> 3: 25. he died for the redemption of tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were under the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb:</hi> 9:15; the means of the ſalvation of the Fathers was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the dayes of the Goſpel: they were saved before, but the price of this Salvation was payed when Chriſt died: that is intended by that expreſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11:40: <hi>God having provided ſome better thing for us, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Righteouſneſs is alſo efficacious for all ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his coming: Chriſt payed for the ſalvation of thoſe Generations that were not born then: he ſatisfied for ſins that were not then committed: for God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Goſpel to be Preached to the end of the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28:19, 20: yea, Chriſt appointed that his death ſhould be ſhewed forth in the Lords Supper, unto the day of Judgment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11:26: in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt, God ſhewed grace to the ages to come, <hi>Eph:</hi> 2:7: there will be ſome ſaved by Chriſt in all Ages to the end of the world, <hi>Eph:</hi> 3:31: the Saints under <hi>Antichriſt</hi> are ſaid to be redeemed by Chriſt, <hi>Revel:</hi> 14:6.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of this everlaſting efficacy of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, is from Gods acceptance: God might accept it as well before it was wrought out as after: and it was as eaſie for Chriſt to redeem millions of men as one: Chriſt being a Surety the ſame righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that will ſerve for one will ſerve for all: as it is with the ſin of <hi>Adam:</hi> it is as ſufficient to condemn millions as one: and if Chriſt had been to redeem ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, he needed not to have done or ſuffered any thing more: what is done by the repreſentative is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to all them whom he repreſents.</p>

                     <p>The laſt Propoſition for the cleaning of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt has ſo purchaſed Salvation, that the Elect cannot fail of it:</hi> and herein lies one great difference between the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and the ſecond: though the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> made us Heirs of death, yet there is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of our eſcaping deſtruction: but the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> has ſo made us Heirs of life as that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that we ſhould miſs thereof: that is intended, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:17. <hi>If by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more they that receive abundance of Grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs ſhall reign in liſe by one Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Chriſts purchaſe gives us ſuch a title to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as that there can be no failure of it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>God has given us everlaſting conſolation and good hope through Grace:</hi> the reaſon of the difference is, becauſe there was an exception in the Law: that we muſt dye except our Surety died for us: but the promiſe of eternal life which Chriſt has purchaſed does admit of no exception: the promiſe made unto Chriſt does admit of no exception, <hi>Pſal</hi> 72 17. <hi>Men ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him:</hi> according to that promiſe to <hi>Jacob,</hi> all the Families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed in his ſeed, and the promiſe made unto Believers does admit of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: there are many promiſes that have a limited interpretation: ſome are indefinite, and ſome are conditional, but this promiſe is abſolute and univerſal, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him might not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but might have everlaſting life:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I leave this Argument, it is needful to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer one Objection; which is this:</p>
                     <p>If Chriſts Righteouſneſs be that which the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, then God would deal with thoſe that have an intereſt in that, as he would have done if they had
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:192038:34"/>performed that righteouſneſs themſelves, as he would have done if <hi>Adam</hi> had kept the covenant of works: but he don't do thus: the promiſe in the covenant of works is life, which includes all manner of felicity: but Believers are far ſhort of felicity, they have much ſin remaining in them, are left to fall into many ſins, they are liable to very ſore and dreadful afflictions, and to death: the promiſe of the Law is not fulfilled to them, therefore it ſeems they have not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Theſe ſorrows do not come upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God for want of a perfect righteouſneſs, or for want of compleat ſatisfaction: and this is an ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, becauſe thoſe ſorrows do not come in a way of vindictive juſtice or vengeance; though they are for the matter of them, the ſame with the curſes of the Law, yet not for the manner: they do not come to ſatisfie God for ſin: thoſe Saints that have the moſt ſin have not always the moſt ſorrow; to be left unto ſin is not a curſe to the people of God; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was left to ſin in mercy: 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 32.31: <hi>It was that be might know what is in his heart: and ſo their afflictions,</hi> Rev. 3.19. <hi>Whom I love, I rebuke and chaſten,</hi> Jer: 24:5: <hi>I have ſent them into the land of the Chaldeans for their good:</hi> Sin opens a door to afflictions, but God brings them in mercy: <hi>All the wayes of the Lord are merccy and truth to ſuch as keep his covenant and his teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 25.10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though Chriſt has fulfilled the righteouſneſs of the Law for us, yet God is not abſolutely bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the righteouſneſs of Chriſt juſt in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he would have done the righteouſneſs of <hi>Adam:</hi> though the righteouſneſs be the ſame yet there may be circumſtantial differences in the reward: bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:192038:35"/>is the reward of righteouſneſs, but there may be ſo the circumſtantial parts of the reward that may differ: as it was with the ſufferings of Chriſt he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not in all things the ſame that the Elect ſhould have done, but yet he ſuffered as much: ſo it is here; Chriſt has purchaſed perfect bleſſedneſs for us, yet he has not ſo purchaſed it, that God is bound to bring us preſently and at once into the poſſeſſion of it: Chriſt has purchaſed the good of the covenant of works, <hi>viz.</hi> bleſſedneſs; to be diſpenſed to us according to the tenor of the covenant of grace, <hi>viz.</hi> to have it begun here, and perfected hereafter: therefore he is called <hi>The Mediator of the new covenant.</hi> Heb. 12.24. <hi>and his ſeed is called the blood of the everlaſting covenant,</hi> Heb. 13.20.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is ſpecial reaſon alſo why God ſhould not wholly deliver his people from ſin and ſorrow in this world: the ſpecial reaſon why he leaves them to ſin, is to take occaſion thereby for the magnifying of his pardoning grace: there are alſo weighty reaſons why he exerciſes his people here with many ſorrows, in particular, that he may vindicate his own holineſs: and that he may carry on the work of Sanctification in them, in a way ſuitable unto the nature of Man.</p>

                  <p>Firſt the foundation that he builds it upon, and then the force of the conſequence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The foundation that he builds this argument on is, That God had ſuch love to ſinners, as to ſend his Son to dye for them: this was an act of wonderful love: it was great love in Chriſt to come to dye, and great love in the Father to ſend him to dye: this was more than man could hope for when he had ſinned, it was quite beyond his expectation; this was ſuch compaſſion as could enter into the heart of none but God himſelf to contrive: if the thoughts of holy,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:192038:41"/>Angels had been asked, they would have thought it too great a mercy to have been beſtowed on ſinful man: they were wonderfully affected with it when it came to paſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 21 13, 14. <hi>there ſuddenly was with the angels a great multitude of the Heavenly Hoſt, praiſing God and ſaying, glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace and good will towards man:</hi> indeed in this affair, God acted principally from a love to his own glory, that he might in this way manifeſt that myſtery of the Trinity, and his glorious attributes, yet this does not derogate from the greatneſs of Gods love in ſending his Son to dye: mans corrupt reaſon is ready to entertain diminitive thoughts of the compaſſions of God in this thing: ſometimes the heart reaſons that God did it for his own glory, but he could have glorified himſelf in mans ruine: or he might have glorified his grace towards the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that fell, and not towards man: and certainly if God did it for his glory, men do very ill to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any thoughts that do diminiſh from the glory of God: ſometimes the heart reaſons, that it would have been hard meaſure for God to have left man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to have periſhed without providing a way of ſalvation: ſeeing we came ſinners into the world, but it was upon no ſuch account that God did it, he was not conſcious of any wrong in his dealings to man: his diſpenſation towards mankind in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them with the loſs of his image for their ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> and in imputing the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> is equal and righteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God:</hi> men likewiſe reaſon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againſt the riches of Gods grace in this thing, from hence that ſin don't hurt God; but though it don't hurt him, yet it wrongs him, if a man ſhould revile his Prince, it may be it would not hurt him, if he ſhould throw ſtones at him, as <hi>Shimei</hi> did at <hi>David,</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:192038:41"/>yet he might not hurt him, but he would wrong him greatly; ſo ſin is a great wrong unto God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned;</hi> and it is wonderful love for God to give his Son to dye for us <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>ſo God loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall paſs by other conſiderations, to help to ſhew the greatneſs of his love, and onely ſelect thoſe five that ſerve to enforce the argument that lies before us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was great love that God ſhould ſend his ſon to endure ſuch ſore ſufferings for us; it was much that God ſhould condeſcend upon any account that his Son ſhould undergo ſuch ſufferings: it was a great thing that God ſhould be willing that Chriſt ſhould be brought into ſuch a condition, when we conſider the glorious excellency of his perſon, and the dear love of the Father to him, it may well be admired by us that God ſhould find in his heart to put him upon ſuch ſufferings: we may well conclude that thoſe perſons for whoſe ſakes all this was, were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved of God, that the heart of God was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily concerned in their good: it was a great thing for the glorious Son of God to ſuffer any thing, much more to bear what he did: his ſuffering was very great, <hi>he was a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief,</hi> Iſa. 53.4.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:192038:42"/>to the croſs, and the weight of his body being born by thoſe wounded parts for ſo many hours, could not be without exquiſite pain: he expreſſes it <hi>by his bones being out of joint, Pſal.</hi> 22.14. it muſt needs be a terrible torture, becauſe perſons that were crucified, was not wont to be very long in that condition before they dyed. The ſuddenneſs of their death could not be from the meer effuſion of blood, but the exquiſiteneſs of their pain contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much to it.</item>
                     <item>2.

                     <item>3. He ſuffered much inward trouble, not onely from the ſence he had of his outward troubles, and from the temptations of the Devil, but alſo from Gods withdrawing the ſence of his ſavour, &amp; putting into him the ſence of his wrath: the fiery wrath of God typified by that fire from heaven that conſumed the ſacrifices, took hold of him: as believers have great inward peace of conſcience ariſing from his righteouſneſs: ſo had he great inward ſorrow ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the guilt of our ſins, he tells his Diſciples, <hi>that his ſoul was very ſorrowful and very heavy, even unto death, Mat.</hi> 26.28. and as this was the occaſion of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:192038:42"/>his ſweating great drops of blood, ſo probably of his ſuddain death: he dyed before the others that were crucified with him, of which it is hard to aſſign any other reaſon than this, that the ſence of Gods wrath much haſtened his death, as God tells <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>no man can ſee his ſace and live:</hi> that is the ſight of Gods love and glory as the Saints ſee it in heaven, is ſuch that the nature of man in this ſtate of mortality can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear it: it would kill him to have ſuch a ſight: ſo there is a parity of reaſon that the ſence of Gods wrath in the extremity of it, is too much for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man to bear, and was the thing that haſtened the death of Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>4. He ſuffered a ſtate of death, and he continued in a ſtate of death for ſome time; his body and ſoul were rent aſunder: which ſtate is contrary unto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the union of body and ſoul was diſſolved, and his body left for a time ſtark dead, and his ſoul in a preternatural eſtate of ſeparation, a ſtate which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does abhorr; exceeding contrary to the inſtinct, and inclination of nature.</item>

                        <item>1. This mercy of giving Chriſt to dye for us, was the firſt thing wherein God laved out himſelf for our ſalvation: when a perſon has layed out himſelf much, and been at great expence for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a deſign, tis a diſappointment to fail of it: and his expence is thereby many times loſt: but God had not been before this at any expence for mans ſalvation: this was the firſt thing wherein God layed out himſelf for our ſalvation: with reſpect to us who live in theſe latter dayes; the death of Chriſt was actually before any other endeavours for our ſalvation: and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe Elect that lived before the coming of Chriſt, his death was vertually before any other expence for their ſalvation, <hi>Rev</hi> 3.8.</item>

                  <p>This Exaltation of Chriſt is a clear evidence of Gods accepting that ſacrifice that he offered up for us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and being fully ſatisfied for our ſins by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Jeſus Chriſt:</p>
                  <p>And there are three things therein, that ſerve to convince us hereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Chriſts Exaltation, he is delivered from that ſuffering eſtate which our ſins brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: he is hereby ſet free from that ſtate of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, which he was in for our ſins: vengeance had taken hold of Chriſt as our ſurety, the juſtice of God ſeized him, he was apprehended as one liable to the Law, and God took vengeance on him, and ſoured out wrath on him; but now by his Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he is ſet at liberty: juſtice has diſmiſſed him, God has done exacting any more puniſhment on him, which is a clear evidence that he is wholly diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of that guilt that was upon him: Chriſt ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted himſelf to the wrath of God, and God puniſhed him as much as he pleaſed, Chriſt bore the curſe, till God laid it was enough, In his reſurrection <hi>God</hi> opened the priſon door, and let him out; God ſent an Officer to deliver him from his grave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 2. <hi>The angel of the Lord deſcended from heaven, and came and rolled back the ſtone from the door.</hi> Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of Chriſt, evidenceth the ſatisfaction that he has received by his ſufferings: if Chriſt were not riſen, it would be an argument that ſins were not ſatisfied for, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen, your faith is vain, ye are yet in your ſins:</hi> but his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhews, that Gods demands are anſwered; and therefore when Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, he is ſaid to be juſtified: God gave him a legal acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:192038:49"/>and diſcharge from that guilt which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſes it thus: <hi>he was quickned in the ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 3.18: ſo that when he was quickned, he was juſtified; Chriſt could never have been delivered out of the hands of Juſtice, if he had not paid the uttermoſt farthing. Hence we are ſaid to have a <hi>lively hope by the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>God has begotten us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to a lively hope by the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead:</hi> this conſideration is a means by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to beget a lively hope in us: the ground of our hope is the reſurrection of Chriſt; it might better be rendred a living hope: the ſame word is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred living, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. this is ſuch an hope as will abide and continue, the hope that is built upon the foundation, will never fail; other hopes may dye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but this is a living hope, a parallel Scripture to this is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>we have the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God by the reſurrection of</hi> Jeſus <hi>Chriſt:</hi> a well-informed conſcience is ſatisfied with this: when a mans conſcience accuſes him of ſins, they are manifeſt, and he can't deny them, heinous and he can't excuſe them: yet this ſilences thoſe accuſations that Chriſt is riſen.</p>
                  <p>Conſcience ſees in the reſurrection of Chriſt, the ſatisfactorineſs of his ſufferings, and has peace on that account that the debt is paid; and upon the ſame account it is that <hi>Paul</hi> attributes power to the refur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. <hi>that I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection,</hi> when God ſets this conſideration home upon the heart, it has a mighty comforting power: this will raiſe up a drooping ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: when a man is diſtreſſed indeed with the guilt of ſia, the world has no power to comfort him, his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:192038:50"/>priviledge cannot, his duties cannot, but this thing ſet home, has power to eaſe his heart, reſieſh his ſoul, ſilence his conſcience: the ſence of this brings great comfort to a chriſtian, and the Apoſtle menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this conſideration as the ſecurity of chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt condemnation; and as that which adds further encouragement to that which riſes from his death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34, <hi>Who is he that condemneth, it is Chriſt thao dyed, yea rather is riſen again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By Chriſts Exaltation, he is rewarded for his ſufferings: God preſently upon his ſufferings took him up into heaven, and bountifully rewarded him for his undertaking: ſome ſeem loth to grant that Chriſt did merit for himſelf, but there is no danger in affirming that according to compact, God did glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly recompence Chriſt for his Obedience and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for us; the primary deſign of Chriſts under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, was to merit for us: but it was every way ſuitable, that this ſervice of his ſhould be rewarded, 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 8.9. <hi>he humbled himſelf, and became obedient to death, the death of the croſs, wherefore alſo God hath highly exalted him:</hi> God took wonderful contentment in it, that Chriſt would lay down his life for us; that is the intendment of that expreſſion, <hi>therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life, John</hi> 10.17. God did highly approve of it, and took a complacency in it, and in Chriſt by reaſon of it; and manifeſted his approbation by rewarding it: Chriſt has a glorious reward in heaven: and this is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he has gone thorow his undertaking: that he has not failed in the work that God committed to him.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt had failed of righteouſneſs, not only we, but he alſo would have failed of glory: Chriſts own
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:192038:50"/>had a dependance upon his working out of perfect righteouſneſs as well as ours: his happineſs and ours were imbarked together: if he had not run the race, he had not been crowned, if he had not been a conquerer, he had not received the prize: if he had ſunk under the work, and not compleated our redemption, God would not have beſtowed this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon him; but ſince he has received a glorious reward, we may conclude he has done his work, and performed the Office of a ſurety: this argument the ſpirit of God makes uſe of: <hi>John</hi> 16.8, 9, 10. <hi>the comforter will convince of righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to my Father, and ye ſee me no more:</hi> the way whereby Chriſt came to ſit <hi>down on the right-hand of the majeſty on high, was the purging of our ſins with his blood, Heb.</hi> 1.3. the thing whereby Chriſt came to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>into the holy place, Was the obtaining of eternal redemption for us, Heb.</hi> 9.12.</p>
                  <p>The way that he came to partake of that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſitting down with his Father on his throne, was the overcoming the difficulties of the work which he undertook, Rev. 3.20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By his Exaltation. he has the adminiſtration of things put into his hands, that he may beſtow upon ſinners that ſalvation, in order to which he ſuffered: that he may put him into the poſſeſſion of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which was the end of his undertaking: it is true, that Jeſus Chriſt entred upon his Kingly power and Office, as well as his other Offices from the firſt publiſhing of the covenant of grace, upon the fall of man: and Jeſus Chriſt did in all ages execute that Office, in governing the world, and beſtowing ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Elect: but the Scriptures do plainly ſet forth that Chriſt has ſome particular adminiſtration
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:192038:51"/>put into his hands, ſince his ſufferings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20.1, 2. ſince his reſurrection, God has put all things under his feet, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. ſpeaking of the ſame time, he ſays <hi>God has given him a name above every name,</hi> Rev. 1.38. <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, Amen. and have the keys of hell and death:</hi> the meaning of theſe Scriptures is that ſince the Exaltation of Chriſt, the Adminiſtrations of things is in the hands of the man Chriſt Jeſus, the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things is carried on by Chriſt as man: the God-head is not excluded, but Chriſt as man has an hand in the government of the world: Chriſt his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature will viſibly mange the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>God will judge the world by the man whom he bath ordained, Acts</hi> 17:31. and this adminiſtration is put into his hands, that he may beſtow eternal life and ſalvation upon ſinners, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. <hi>him hath God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted with his right-hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Iſrael and remiſſion of ſins:</hi> and if God preſently upon the obedience and ſufferings of Chriſt, has put ſuch power into his hands, it is a clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he has fully paid for our ſalvation: if Chriſt had fallen ſhort of purchaſing our ſalvation, God would not have given him a commiſſion to have beſtowed it: God would have ſtood for full ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he would have objected that it would have bin againſt juſtice to have ſaved them: but now Chriſt having fully paid the debt, God exalts Chriſt to his own right-hand, and inveſts him with full authority to bring them unto bleſſedneſs.</p>

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a relying upon God: God is the ultimate object of Faith: what Chriſt does in order to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he does as the Meſſenger and ſervant of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo that Faith is to reſt upon God; therefore we are ſaid to come to God by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.

                     </list>
                     <p n="2">2. The Scripture does propoſe Chriſt to be believed on, both as the purchaſer and diſpenſer of ſalvation; the Word of God does propoſe him to be the object of Faith, both as purchaſer and diſpenſer of life: <hi>he is made to us for Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> he is declared to be the <hi>purchaſer of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6. <hi>He has given himſelf a ranſom for us: ſo he is declared to be the diſpenſer of it: He has po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over all fleſh, to give eternal life to as many as God has given him,</hi> John 17.2. Chriſt is not a Prieſt only, but a Prophet and a King; and our Faith does not juſtifie us meerly as it relies upon the blood and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, which are the matter of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but as it entertains Jeſus Chriſt; for that is the condition of the covenant.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It cannot be proved from the Word of God, that a man can come to Chriſt for Salvation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relying particularly upon his righteouſneſs: it will not be evinced from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that a man can cloſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:192038:54"/>with Chriſt as a saviour in general; and not diſtinctly selt upon him as having ſatisfied the juſtice of God for us: becauſe the heart will not be ſatisfied in the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of coming to Chriſt, except he ſee a way how the Law is anſwered: and therefore God has taken care from the beginning of the World to make known the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, and there was a continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of them in the ancient Church: he that underſtands not the ſtrictneſs of the Law cannot ſee the need of Chriſt, and he that underſtands not the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt cannot ſee the ſafety that is in Chriſt, for ſuch who are under the ſentence of ſo ſtrict a Laws there is one great difficulty in the way of receiving this poſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Diſciples of Chriſt, who were good men, and did believe in Chriſt: and profeſſed that he had the words of eternal life, yet did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſufferings of Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 9 31, 32. <hi>He ſaid to them, the Son of man is detivered into the hands of Men, and they ſhall kill him, and after that he is killed he ſhall riſe again the third day, but they underſtood not that ſaying:</hi> ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 16 21, 22. and when he ſuffered it made them queſtion whether he was the Meſſiah, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.21. But it is poſſible they might believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſts ſufferings: and yet not underſtand either that manner of it, that it ſhould be done by the Prieſts and people of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> or not underſtand the time of it, being carried away with the vulgar error of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> would ſet up a glorious worldly Kingdom: but it is very hard to conceive, that they ſhould be wholly ignorant of the ſignification of the Sacrifices, and of the meaning of many Prophecies of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> reſpecting this thing. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:192038:55"/>ſuch promiſes as make mention of holineſs don't make Gods covenant with believers conditional: holineſs is no ſuch condition as renders the ſalvation of believers queſtionable: ſuch promiſes as mention it only ſhew the order and way wherein God will beſtow ſalvation to believers: holineſs is a promiſed condition: God is engaged to give holineſs to Believers, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.22, 23 holineſs cannot be properly; a condition becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his perſeverance in holineſs he is juſtified, that is declared an heir of glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is already fulfilled: God offers life to ſinners up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the condition of believing: and the way mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that condition is excluſive of any other.</p>
                     <p>The invitation to believe is ſometime directed to ſome particular ſorts of ſinners, as to thoſe that are <hi>thirſty,</hi> Iſai, 55.1. to thoſe <hi>that labour and are heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> Mat. 11.28. but it is one thing for an invitation to be particularly applied to this or that ſort of ſinners, another thing for it to be confined unto them: the invitation is directed to all ſinners that live under the Goſpel, except thoſe that have committed the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſin: the promiſe is abſolute to all Believers, without any exception at all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>God has not only ſaid it, but given it us under his hand, left it upon record; to be a witneſs for us: <hi>this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son,</hi> John 5.11. and we may qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly rely on this: it is impoſſible that the promiſe of God ſhould fail of its accompliſhment: <hi>God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> 1 Theſ, 5.23. <hi>he is very faithful,</hi> Pſal. 119.138. <hi>his faithfulneſs reacheth unto the clouds,</hi> Pſal. 36.5. <hi>it endureth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 117.2.

                        <hi>he always minds his covenant,</hi> Pſal. 111.5. his promiſes are all written on his heart, no tract of time can wear them out of his remembrance: <hi>he has remembred his covenant for ever, the word which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to a thouſand generations,</hi> Pſal. 105.8. God is unchangeable, men are fickle and inconſtant, in one mind to day, and another to morrow: ſometimes men change their minds out of meer fickleneſs, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the change of their condition, or divers appearances in providences, but God is not ſubject to any mutation: his purpoſes are more firm, than mountains of braſs: he ſays <hi>repentance ſhall be hid from his eyes,</hi> Hoſ. 13.14. God is perfectly holy, and therefore cannot fail of his word: men having a principle of ſin in them, may be out-bid to neglect the fulſilling of their promiſes; but there is not the leaſt ſpark of unholineſs in God; holineſs is his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Iſa</hi> 6.3. yea ſuch is the perfection of Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he is not liable to thoſe temptations to ſpeak falſe that men are, men ſometime ſpeak falſe out of fear; they fear the anger and contempt of men: but God fears none; men ſometimes ſpeak falſe in hope of gain: <hi>Jacob</hi> lies to get the bleſſing, <hi>Gehezi</hi> to enrich himſelf, but God is not capable to gain any thing by the creature: men ſometimes ſpeak falſe that they may appear better than they are, but it is impoſſible that God ſhould appear more gracious and glorious than he is: men ſometimes decline the fulfilling of their promiſes, becauſe it proves difficult to do it, or brings ſome unthought of inconveniencies upon them; but every thing is eaſie to God, every thing is known unto him before the foundation of the world: God having engaged ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to believers; they may ſay as <hi>David, therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed, &amp;c.</hi> the

                     <hi>They that are commanded of God to believe in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt may ſafely appear before</hi> God <hi>in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: but we are commanded by God to believe in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: though the calls of the</hi> Goſpel <hi>are many times propounded in a way of invitation, they are ſet before us as gracious offers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is in a way of grace tendring a great benefit unto us, yet they have the force of commands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might argue the ſafety of coming unto Chriſt, from thence that we are invited to come unto him for help: for ſurely in thoſe invitations God does not go about to delude men, and lovingly draw them in to take ſuch a method for the ſalvation of their ſouls, as would fail them: 'tis not to be imagined, that the glorious God would with great ſeeming love to the ſouls of men, draw them into a ſnare, and with an appearance of good-will to them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them to take a courſe that were not ſafe: it is not to be thought that God would lovingly, and with a great deal of tenderneſs perſwade men to ſet their feet on ſlippery places, and build their hopes upon a ſandy foundation: there is no ſoul deluſion in the Goſpel: he would not urge men with ſuch compaſſion to put their truſt in Chriſt, but that the well-fare of their ſouls is ſecured
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:192038:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>thereby: they may without fear venture upon the counſel and entreaties of the Lord: being ſecure in that that God will not lead them into danger: when God adviſes us to truſt in Chriſt, he commands this way to us as a way of ſafety: for 'tis no part of love to adviſe us to put our confidence in a broken reed: but beſides what might be argued this way, theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations have in them, the force of commands, and lay us under duty in obedience unto God, to come unto Chriſt: as there is love in theſe calls, ſo there is authority alſo; we are not left at liberty, whether we will come to Chriſt or no, but are required to come. God does preſcribe this way, and enforce it both by his love and alſo his authority: God that has put Jeſus Chriſt into office, doth require us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in all his offices, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 2:12. and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways to be putting our truſt in him: therefore this is called <hi>the work of</hi> God, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. this is the great buſineſs that he has ſet us to do; and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>his commandment,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. which ſhews not only that it is commanded, but that this is the ſpecial commandment, that God lays peculiar weight upon: and hence it is a ſin for men not to believe in Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>this the ſpirit reproves for,</hi> John 16.9. <hi>of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me:</hi> hence God is angry with thoſe that ſtay away from Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.21.</p>
                  <p>This command of believing in Chriſt is a branch of the ſecond commandment in the Law; by that command it is required, that we ſhould worſhip in that way that he appoints, that we ſhould attend ſuch worſhip as is inſtituted by him, &amp; not deviſed by man, and this is the great inſtitution of God under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, that we worſhip him by Jeſus Chriſt, ſeek to God through him, and believe in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:192038:58"/>God thorough him: Jeſus Chriſt is the great ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that God has ſet up to be worſhipped by: Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as God is to be worſhipped with divine worſhip, by vertue of the firſt command; Jeſus Chriſt as mediator, is the means whereby we are to draw nigh to God, by vertue of the ſecond command, as the ſacrifices of old were a principal ordinance whereby God was to be worſhipped, ſo Chriſt who was typified by thoſe ſacrifices, was and is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ordinance whereby fallen man is to draw nigh unto God: and through whom we are to believe in him.</p>
                  <p>And this command of God does argue the ſafety of appearing in Chriſts Righteouſneſs, the command of God does evidence our aſſnred ſalvation in this way; this would never have been commanded of God if it were not ſafe.</p>
                  <p>And this appears by three things:
<list>
                        <item>1. If it be commanded, that we believe in Jeſus Chriſts Righteouſneſs, then it is lawful for us ſo to do; God would never put us upon that, which its own nature is not lawful, it muſt needs be a warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing for us to put our truſt in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: there can be no unlawfulneſs in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which God requires: but if it were not ſafe to appear in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, it could not be lawful to believe in it; it would be an irregular thing to put our truſt therein and that on two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.
<list>
                              <item>1. It would be a putting of too much honour upon Chriſt and his righteouſneſs: if it were not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:192038:59"/>ſafe appearing in Chriſts Righteouſneſs, then Chriſts Righteouſneſs were not worthy to be believed in: if it were not ſafe truſting in it, then we ſhould give too high a commendation to it, when we believe in it: for when we believe in it, we proclaim it to be ſafe ſo to do: it would be an idolizing of Chriſts righ teouſneſs, to truſt in it, if it were not ſafe ſo to do; it is a fault to believe in that which cannot ſave: when we believe in Chriſts Righteouſneſs, we give him the honour of having purchaſed ſalvation for us, if it were not ſafe to truſt in Chriſts righteouſneſs, then in ſo doing we ſhould give him a glory that belongs not to him.</item>
                              <item>2. It would be ſelf-flattery for us to believe in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; if it were not ſafe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in it, it could not be lawful to truſt in it: to truſt in it would be preſumption, what would it be, but to delude our ſelves, and to pleaſe our ſelves with an idle dream, which would deceive us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        </item>
                        <item>2. If it be commanded that we believe on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, then it is duty ſo to doe: then we are bound in conſcience to come unto Chriſt, we cannot without ſin ſtay away from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and therefore ſurely it is ſafe to truſt in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt: the holy <hi>God would</hi> never make
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:192038:59"/>it our duty to truſt in that which is not a ſufficient ground of faith: it were an hard leſſon to be bound in conſcience to do that, which we could not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our conſciences in doing: it were wildneſs for any man to imagine that God ſhould command us to love that which is not lovely, or to mourn for that which is not matter of ſorrow, or to rejoyce in that which is not matter of joy: ſo it is to think that God ſhould require us to truſt in that which is not a ground of confidence: that would be very hard for God to bind us to put our confidence in that which we could not put our confidence in, except we were out of our wits: if it were not ſafe to truſt in Chriſts righteouſneſs, what could induce us to do it, except we were under a deluſion: it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature for man to put confidence in any thing but under this notion, that there is ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in it: what perſwaſions can prevail to make men reſt on that, which they could not ſafely reſt upon: the Lord is a righteous God, and gives no ſuch unequal command, all his commands are righteous, he requires but what is equal, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119:138.</item>
                        <item>3. If God commands us to believe on the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt, then we muſt do it upon pain of damnation, if we fail thereof: every ſin does by Law deſerve death: and the continuance in the neglect of any known command does unavoidably bring death and ruine, and ſo the neglect of this command, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already, becauſe be hath not believed in the Name of the only begotton Son of God:</hi> certainly then it muſt be a ſafe thing to believe on Jeſus Chriſt: if there be no ſafety in believing, there is no reaſon that we ſhould be puniſhed for not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: if there be no ſafety in believing in Chriſt, then
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:192038:60"/>it is madneſs to believe in Chriſt, and will God puniſh us for not acting the part of mad men: it were an unreaſonable thing for a man to believe in Chriſt if it were not ſafe ſo to do; and therefore unreaſonable that he ſhould be puniſhed for not doing of it: will God damn man for not building their hopes for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen upon the ſand? will God caſt a man into Hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe be will not embrace a deluſion, and put his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in a broken Reed? the Lord is a righteous God, and would never puniſh men for not believing if they had not abundant encouragement to believe: the command of this holy God gives us great ſecurity in believing, <hi>John</hi> 12.50. <hi>I know that his command is life everlaſting.</hi>

                  <p>Here it may be objected againſt this Argument, <hi>That we are commanded by God to believe for many things, and to believe in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, for them which we have no certain ſecurity that we ſhall enjoy in a way of believing: whatever we pray for, we muſt do it believing; and we muſt do it in the Name of Chriſt: thus we are to believe for health; for the converſion of all our Children, for rain and other publick mercies: ſo that it is no bard or unreaſonable thing to be commanded to believe; for that which is not ſure in a way of believing, neither do we want ſufficient encouragement to believe, though the thing we believe for be not ſure to us in that way:</hi>

                     <hi>ANSWER.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Act of Faith which is the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is far differing from other acts of Faith that are required of us: we do believe for a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:192038:60"/>when by a ſpirit of Faith we take hold of any of thoſe encouragements which God gives us, with reſpect to that mercy: that when we are encouraged by the power of God, the mercy of God, the love of God to us, indennite promiſes; the redemption of Chriſt to rely upon God with quietneſs for a mercy, with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his holy will. We do believe in God for that mercy; and this we have ſufficient encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do, though there be no certainty that we ſhall enjoy the mercy in that way: and this God may fairly command us, though he don't abſolutely promiſe the mercy: but that Faith which is the condition of the covenant of Grace does much differ from this: that is an accepting of Chriſt and Salvation by him as offered to us: and a relying on him for it according to the promiſe of the Goſpel: that this is the Faith that is required as the condition of the covenant of grace is evident, becauſe it is called a receiving of Chriſt: juſtifying Faith is the receiving of the promiſe of the Goſpel: 'tis a relying upon God in Chriſt according to the invitations of the Goſpel: and God would never require us to accept of an offer, and rely upon him for it, if it were not ſafe ſo to do: how is it poſſible for any man to rely upon God for the making good of his offer if it were not ſafe ſo to do.</p>

                  <p>THat Righteouſneſs which the Spirit of God convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and aſſures men, that they may ſafely appear before God in; that they may ſafely appear in: but the Spirit of God does convince and aſſure men that they may ſafely appear before God in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt: that muſt needs be true which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril convinces men to be true: Satan labours to ſhake mens belief of this, and raiſes doubts and queſtions in the heart about it, and from thence we may argue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably that it is true; but the ſpirit of God does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and convince men of the truth of it, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes the heart in it, and from thence may infallibly argue the truth of it.</p>

                  <p>In opening and declaring this Argument, we may Conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That many men are convinced and aſſured, that it is fafe appearing before God in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: there are ſome kind of perſwaſions about it in the hearts of many others, that are beſtowed partly upon the teſtimony of men, partly upon the rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Doctrine; and theſe perſwaſions may work ſome conſiderable effects on their hearts: but thoſe are ſome that have a thorow conviction of it, whoſe hearts are truly ſatisfied in the truth of it:</p>
                  <p>This is Evident,
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe they do believe this: the Doctrine of the Goſpel is believed by many, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.7. <hi>That the Gentiles by my mouth ſhould hear the word of the Goſpel and believe:</hi> there be ſome that do receive the teſtimony of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.33. and by Faith entertain the Doctrine of Salvation by his ſufferings, tho they be but few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.1. and therefore they are aſſured of it: for that knowledg which we have of things by Faith in God is certain: that knowledg which we have of things by our believing the teſtimony of man is fallible, and it leaves room for doubtings: but the knowledg that we have of things by our believing the teſtimony of God is certain, and as abundantly ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the heart as that which we have by the ſeeing of the eye, or by demonſtration: the knowledg that we have by Faith is a knowledg at ſecond hand: but God gives us ſufficient aſſurance that it is he that ſpeaks, and that his teſtimony is true: therefore when men do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are ſaid to be perſwaded, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. <hi>They
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:192038:62"/>ſaw the promiſes afar off, and were perſwaded of them:</hi> ſo they are ſaid to know ſurely, <hi>John</hi> 17.8. <hi>they have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that thou didſt ſend me:</hi> So they are ſaid to be ſure, <hi>John</hi> 6 69. <hi>We believe and are ſure that thou art the Chriſt.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe they believe on Chriſt, and venture their ſouls upon him 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Believed on in the World,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13 <hi>I have written to you that believe on the Son of God:</hi> and this is the effect of their aſſurance, that it is ſafe appearing in Chriſts righteouſneſs: if they were not convinced of that, no Arguments would perſwade them to venture upon Chriſt: when men come to Chriſt they come under that conviction, that it is ſafe coming unto him: the <hi>Goſpel works effectually in them that believe,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2.13. every one that comes to Chriſt <hi>hath the witneſs in himſelf,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.10. this makes them come with boldneſs unto Chriſt; tho there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others that are afraid to come: if they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the truth of the Goſpel they would be afraid to come too: they would not dare to caſt themſelves on Chriſt, before they were convinced they withſtood all Arguments that could be uſed with them: they had their anſwers ready, and their excuſes at hand, they had an unperſwadable ſpirit, ſomewhat to turn off all that could be ſaid: and the reaſon that now they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture themſelves on Chriſt is not any ſelf-excellency, for they come to him when they are at worſt, when they ſee the plague of their own hearts; but is it becauſe they are convinced of the ſafety that is in Chriſt: <hi>to them that believe Chriſt is precious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7.</item>
                        <item>3. Becauſe they have comfortable and gracious hopes of glory: there be many flattering hopes of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs that ungodly men do entertain, that depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:192038:62"/>their vain conceits; but the people of God have a gracious hope of glory: and the hopes of the people of God do principally depend on the conviction of theſe two things:
<list>
                              <item>1. That there is ſafety in Chriſts righteouſneſs; and then that they have an intereſt in it, have received it: their Faith of dependance ariſes from the conviction of the firſt, but their hope ariſes from both together: 'tis true that their hopes do riſe from the belief of other promiſes of glory, together with a ſight of the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in the mſelves that are mentioned in thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: thus Saints have hope from thoſe promiſes that are made to thoſe that love God, that mortifie ſin, that love the Saints, that are patient under afflictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the fundamental promiſe of the Goſpel is that which is made to believing in Chriſt: and the hopes of chriſtians do principally ariſe from the conviction of Chriſts righteouſneſs, together with our intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 8. <hi>Believing ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory:</hi> Rom. 15.13. <hi>The God of hope fill you with joy and peace in believing.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>2. This conviction is not the fruit of mens natural reaſon; natural reaſon tho advantaged with external revelation, cannot ſatisfie the heart that it is ſafe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: natural reaſon may work ſome conviction of this truth, and diſcover ſo much of it that a man may come to look upon it very rational and probable: but it cannot diſcover the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it: fleſh and blood can't reveal that: natural reaſon may make ſuch a diſcovery of this truth, that they may be urged in conſcience to believe in Chriſt, and condemned in conſcience for not believing in him, that they may think thoſe happy that do believe in him: that they judg thoſe groſly erroneous that do decy
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:192038:63"/>this Doctrine: but yet it will not give ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction as can aſſure the ſoul that it is ſo indeed, men are apt to think that they are ſatisfied, that there is ſafety in relying on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, only they queſtion whether God does call them as the caſe is circumſtanced with them to rely upon him, but they delude themſelves: mans reaſon does not diſcover the certainty of this truth by all the helps that the world does afford; yea, though they do partake of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward common illumination: <hi>the nature of man recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him, neither can he know them becauſe they are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. There is a twofold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in natural reaſon that hinders men from receiving of this Truth.</item>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. Natural reaſon cannot apprehend that <hi>God</hi> can find in his heart to ſave ſinners on the account of Chriſts righteouſneſs: when men come to be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and have a ſence of the guilt of ſin, and wrath of <hi>God,</hi> it will not enter into them, that <hi>God</hi> can be free to forgive them, and ſave them on the account of Chriſts blood; they are ſtrangers unto the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nature of <hi>God:</hi> and hence are ſeeking to get ſome worthineſs of their own, to pacifie <hi>God</hi> with: and can't conceive that God is willing to pardon them, who are ſo unworthy; except they were ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better: they think they muſt have ſomething to commend them to God: they think it would be mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for them as bad as they are to venture on Chriſts bloud. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. <hi>the preaching of the croſs is to them that periſh, fooliſhneſs:</hi> they have ſtrange and low thoughts of the mercy of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.8.</item>

                     <item>2. Natural reaſon will not make men believe Gods teſtimony; natural reaſon will not beget ſaith: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men are in Scripture deſcribed to be unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>John</hi> 5, 46. natural reaſon will not lay weight on the teſtimony of God: no man will receive Gods teſtimony, and act faith thereupon, until he knows God, <hi>Paul ſays, I know him whom I have believed,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. and every man muſt know God before he will believe him: many men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o entertain ſome of the things that God ſays; ſo the Devils believe and tremble: but thoſe perſwaſions riſe from the convictions, and not from faith in Gods Word. No man will receive any thing meerly on Gods teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, until he know him: and therefore will not be aſſured of that which he can know no other way but by faith, and which carnal reaſon has many obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt.</item>
                     <item>3. The conviction of this Truth is by the Spirit of God: it is the work of Gods Spirit to ſatisfie the heart in this, that it is ſafe appearing in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: God does create light in the mind to diſcover this: the outward call of the Goſpel preſents the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before men, and the work of the Spirit is to give men eyes to ſee the truth of it: mens natural reaſon makes them underſtand the ſenſe of the Propoſition: and the Spirit of God puts a new light in them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they underſtand the truth of the Propoſition: their perſwaſion about this is the fruit of Divine Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This I ſhall ſhew from ſeveral Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</p>
                  <p>John 16.7, 8. <hi>The comforter will reprove the World of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment:</hi> in this Text for the clearing of what is before us, we ſhall take notice of three things:</p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:192038:64"/>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That the comforter here is the Spirit of God: this is clear not only becauſe he was a perſon ſent to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in and ſucceed the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles: but alſo becauſe he is called <hi>the Spirit of truth,</hi> John 14.16, 17. <hi>He ſhall give you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. That the works of the Spirit here is conviction: ſo 'tis in the Margent, the word ſignifies to convince by Argument and Reaſon; and here is the Argument that the Spirit ſhall convince by <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Becauſe I go to my Father and ye ſee me no more,</hi> ſo the word is uſed, <hi>John</hi> 8.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24.</item>
                     <item>3. That the thing that the Spirit does convince of, is our ſafety in Chriſts Righteouſneſs: it is his righteouſneſs that he ſpeaks of: for his going to the Father is the argument of it; and it is the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his righteouſneſs to our ſalvation,</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This is clear by two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Spirit is promiſed to confirm the Doctrine of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>And then Secondly, becauſe the argument menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>verſe</hi> 10 does confirm this truth: Chriſts Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention to the right-hand of God, ſhews, that he has performed the work he came for, and wrought righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father, commeth unto me:</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this is not that all that were godly among the Jews, that had been taught of God, ſhould ackow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30 <hi>And whom he called them he alſo juſtified;</hi> by this Scripture it appears that it is Gods work to ſatisfie the heart in the ſafety of coming to Chriſt; when he ſayes, that they are called of God, he means they are inwardly called of God: he intends not the outward call, becauſe he ſpeaks of it as a proper effect of Predeſtination, and certain fore-runner of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and this inward call is nothing elſe but the enlightning of the mind to ſee the truth, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the outward call: ſo that thoſe Arguments which God ſets before us in his Word to perſwade us to come to Chriſt: thoſe he ſatisfies our hearts in, by the inward work of his Spirit: by his Spirit he ſets home the precepts, invitations and promiſes of the Goſpel: this inward Call is that which ſatisfies the heart; ſo that it anſwers the call of God.</p>
                  <p>Objection, 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It ſeems not to be work of the Spirit to convince
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:192038:66"/>men that they may ſafely appear in Chriſts Righteouſneſs; becauſe after they have been convinced, they doubt again, and call it in queſtion whether they may venture on the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may well argue, that if they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced throughly by the ſpirit, that they will never be utterly carried away with unbelief to reject this truth: but we cannot conclude that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubt: men may call thoſe things in queſtion which they have learned by the ſpirit of God: ſo the <hi>Prophet</hi> did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.17, 18, 19. yea, men may que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion things that they have been taught by the ſaving work of the ſpirit: God revealed it to the Diſciples, that Jeſus was the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16, 17. yet afterwards they queſtioned it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.21. <hi>they ſay, we verily thought it had been he that ſhould have redeemed Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> no doubt had been convinced that God is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, and yet afterwards, he had ſuch workings of heart as theſe, <hi>verily I have cleanſed my heart in vain,</hi> Pſa. 73.13: and it is no wonder, for the blindneſs of the mind is but in part removed, and ſometimes they have not the exerciſe of that light which is in them: the Devil is buſie to throw ſcruples and objections into their hearts; and they have ſeveral principles in themſelves that lead them to doubt of thoſe things that God has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them of: they have a principle of unbelief, carnal reaſon and enmity to the truth, ſo that it is no wonder that they have doubts about it.</p>
                  <p>Objection, 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If men were convinced by the ſpirit they would have more
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:192038:66"/>underſtanding than many of them have of this way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, many of them underſtood very little of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this way of Salvation with the Law of God: how the ſufferings of one could anſwer for ſo many, there are maeny Objections that they dont ſee through:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every one that is taught of the ſpirit has ſo much knowledg in this way of life, as is a foundation for Faith: he muſt have ſo much knowledg as that his Conſcience may be ſatisfied in the truth of it: tis alſo true that the teachings of the ſpirit do clarifie mens underſtandings: they come hereby to have more clear conceptions of Goſpel truths: but men may be taught by the ſpirit and yet be very unable to give a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Objections: the Diſciples were taught of God that Jeſus was the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. and yet knew not what to ſay to that Objections that <hi>Elias muſt firſt come,</hi> Mat. 17.19. tho a Chriſtian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer many Objections about the ſufficiency of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, yet he knows that, that will ſatisfie his heart that it is ſufficient: namely, that God gives this teſtimony to it; and invites him to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider in what way the ſpirit of God works this conviction and aſſurance: and that is by a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al illumination of the mind: the ſpirit of God is not wont in adult perſons to reveal this Doctrine in any extraordinary way: he works this conviction in ſuch adult perſons only as have the knowledg of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by hearing and reading of the Word: men muſt not expect to be taught that in a miraculous way which they may learn in an ordinary way: neither would this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:192038:67"/>be ſuffieient to work a through conviction and aſſurance of it: a man may have things revealed unto him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily by God, that has no Faith; as <hi>Balaam</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does the Spirit aſſure men of this in way of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony: the Spirit of God is wont to teſtifie and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſome things to the ſoul of the Saints, <hi>the Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirits that we are the children of God,</hi> Rom. 8.16. but he does not in that way reveal unto men the truth of the Doctrine of the Goſpel: but he openeth our eyes to ſee the truth of it: the Spirit gives us eyes to ſee, and alſo the actual underſtanding of the truth of the Goſpel: he puts a principle of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual underſtanding into us by a work of creation; <hi>ye were ſometimes darkneſs, but now are ye light in the Lord;</hi> Eph. 5.8. he alſo aſſiſts us actually to diſcern the truth of this way of ſalvation by Chriſt: while the ſoul is hearing, reading, and meditating of it, he puts a light into him, diſcovering it to be true: and ſometimes while the ſoul is thinking of his miſery, the ſpirit brings to remembrance ſome word, and with that puts in a light into the ſoul that ſatisfies the heart in the truth of the Goſpel: and this is wrought theſe three wayes:
<list>
                        <item>1. The Spirit helps us to ſee the truth of this in the teſtimony of God in his Word: 'tis not any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teſtimony that our Faith depends upon: but the teſtimony of God in his Word, and the inward work of the Spirit is to help us to receive the ſure Word of Prophecy; and depend upon that: God witneſſes in his Word plentifully to that, that there is ſalvation wrought out for us by Chriſt, that he has redeemed us. purged away ſins, brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs: and in this teſtimony of God we ſee the truth of the thing it ſelf: the Spirit ſatisfies the heart and clears it up to him, that this is Gods teſtimony, that it is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:192038:67"/>that it is not any device or forgery of man under a pretence of Gods teſtimony: but that this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Word of God: the Word comes in Gods Name, and has many characters of divine authority in it; and the ſoul is ſatisfied that it is Gods Word, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God:</hi> The Spirit alſo ſatisfies the heart in the faithfulneſs of God: naturally men have no aſſurance of the faithfulneſs of God, though they profeſs it: but the ſpirit convinces the ſoul, that the Lord is a God of truth: <hi>I know him whom I have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> 2 Tim 1 12. he does with <hi>Sarah</hi> judge him faithful that has promiſed: and here though his ſoul be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him, yet he can quietly venture it upon his Word.</item>
                        <item>2. The Spirit helps us to ſee the certainty of this in a way of reaſoning from other Principles, which we do undoubtedly receive: there is an aſſurance by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſuch things as we are certain of: this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the demonſtration of the ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.4. when once a man is principled in that foundation, that the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God in his Word is certain and infallible: then he is aſſured of ſuch principles as theſe, that Jeſus Chriſt who was our Surety is exalted to the right hand of God: that ſinners are invited to rely upon the blood of Chriſt: that Chriſt has fulfilled the righteouſneſs of the Law for us; for theſe things are plainly laid down in the Word of God; he had the notion of theſe things before, but now he is aſſured of them, and being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, God help, him to argue from them the infallible certainty of ſalvation by Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>John</hi> 16.10. <hi>the ſpirit convinces of righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to my Father:</hi> ſo a Chriſtian ſometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is come to Chriſt, finds by experience in that way the ſanctifying and comforting preſence of God
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:192038:68"/>with him: and from hence he argues, and is more eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Doctrine of ſalvation by Chriſt.</item>

The Spirit helps to ſee the glorious excellency of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and thereby the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of his heart do vaniſh away, and fall of their own accord: there are ſome leſs Objections which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe for want of diſtinct knowledg, and from a miſ-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of ſome places of Scripture, which though they prove temptations, yet don't wholly hinder the workings of Faith: but the main Objections of the heart were that God could not find in his heart to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſuch ſins as they have been guilty of, and that the Law threatens them with ruine: but the ſpirit diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unto the ſoul the excellency of God in Chriſt, the riches of Gods grace, and the preciouſneſs of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, and then thoſe Objections fall, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.7. <hi>How excellent is thy loving-kindneſs O Lord, therefore the ſons of men put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings,</hi> Joh. 17.3. <hi>This is life eternal that they might know thee, the only true God and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>

                  <p>That this is a great work of Gods Spirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince men and aſſure them that it is ſafe appearing in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: it is a matter of exceeding great difficulty to give entertainment unto this truth: and hence it is that many men are never ſatisfied in it all their dayes, they continue all their lives long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the means of grace, and yet never come unto the knowledg of this truth, and many others whom God has perſwaded of it have been long before they were ſatisfied, though they have been full of inward troubles
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:192038:68"/>and fears and thereby put upon it to be inquiſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of ſalvation, yet were long before they came to Chriſt, their hearts were unſatisfied about their ſafety in ſo doing: and after prevailing and clear conviction, doubts are ever and anon ariſing in their hearts, and this difficulty muſt needs be very great, conſidering theſe things:
<list>
                        <item>1. That Man in his natural ſtate is an enemy to this way of ſalvation: as man is an enemy to the Law of God, ſo to the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: the heart dont like this way of ſalvation, man had rather be ſaved in another way; man is proud and can't endure to go a begging and be beholden to the free grace of God for his ſalvation: he had rather earn it himſelf, than take it as a gift of God: hence men ſet their wits on work to deſcry another way that is more ſuitable to their honours, and to find exceptions againſt this way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt: he don't like the method, and ſo is inventing of cavils to turn off the calls of God.</item>
                        <item>2. That man is ignorant of the gracious nature of God: men don't underſtand how merciful God is; are apt to meaſure the compaſſions of God by their own; and make a judgment of God by themſelves: hence they are full of carnal reaſonings againſt this way of life: they think it is a great deal more probable that they ſhould be accepted on the account of ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs in themſelves: they think it utterly unlikely that God ſhould accept of them, till their hearts are better; they think it would be deſperate preſumption to venture upon Chriſt before they are better; they think God is ſo angry with them that he cannot find in his heart to pardon them: they take notice of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of God upon others, and conceive of him as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:192038:69"/>very difficult to pardon, they imagine there muſt be ſomething conſiderable in them to commend them to God, and draw the heart of God unto them.</item>
                        <item>3 The Devil is buſie to hinder men from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this truth: the Devil is moſt induſtrious in this matter, becauſe their entertaining this truth will deliver them from his dominion: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3, he is poſſeſſing of men with prejudices againſt this truth, caſting in objections, and fortifying of the heart againſt the perſwaſions of the word: and this does conſiderably increaſe the difficulty, becauſe of the ſubtilty of Satan to repreſent his temptations with great appearance of reaſon, and ſmooth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, ſo that it ſhall have a great face of truth, &amp; becauſe of his ability, together with his reaſonings to work ſo upon the affections, as to make the ſoul more oppoſite to the entertaining of the truth.</item>
                        <item>4. Man by nature does not believe the teſtimony of God: this truth cannot certainly be known but by faith, reaſon may argue ſomething for it, but not concluſively: but natural men are deſtitute of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to receive the teſtimony of God: they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the glorious nature of God, and ſo of his faithfulneſs, and therefore though they may look on it a thing probable, becauſe of Gods teſtimony, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard a ſame of him, yet they cannot be aſſured of it upon his word; ſince they know him not: ſo that it is a great and wonderful work of Gods ſpirit to help men over all theſe difficulties, and convince them that 'tis ſafe appearing in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</item>

<list>
                        <item>1. The Spirit of God is holy, and cannot deceive or delude us, it is in conſiſtent with the ſpotleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſpirit of God to convince us of that which is not true: who can imagine that the holy ſpirit of God would take pains with men, and work a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous change in them, to make them believe a lie: why does God buſie himſelf ſo in this work, but that it is of everlaſting concernment unto the ſouls of men: it is true, that God may judicially blind men by withdrawing light from them, but he never goes about to perſwade men of a lye: would God perſwade men to caſt themſelves upon Chriſt, if there were not ſafety in ſo doing.</item>
                        <item>2. We are commanded <hi>not to quench the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. we muſt cheriſh the motions, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the convictions of the ſpirit; which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would not be our duty, if the ſpirit did convince of any thing that is not true: we are not bound to receive deluſions, but by all means to be opppoſing and reſiſting of them, it cannot be our duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſalſhoods, and give way to deceits: and therefore thoſe convictions which we are bound to cheriſh, are certainly true:</item>

                  <p>I might alſo argue from the manner of the ſpirits convincing, which is by enlightning, and opening of the eyes: but if this which he convinces us of were not true, the conviction would be by blinding of us, and putting out our eves: where one by ſophiſtical reaſonings does perſwade another of a ſalſhood,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:192038:70"/>makes him believe a lye; he does it by darkening his underſtanding: the opening of the eyes is not the way to lead men into error.</p>

                     <hi>That Righteouſneſs upon the account of which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows the beginnings of ſalvation here; it is ſafe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God in: but upon the account of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, God beſtows the beginnins of ſalvation here.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſome degrees of ſalvation which God beſtows upon believers here upon the account of his righteouſneſs: they have an inchoation of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation already. God begins to fullfil his promiſe preſently, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. they are juſtified al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.39. <hi>all that believe are juſtified:</hi> they are adopted, 1 <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</hi> they are ſaved from the curſe of the law as to outward diſpenſations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God, that are called according to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>I</hi> ſhall only urge two things wherein the people of God have experience of the beginning of ſalvation, and therein an evidence of their full ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jeſus Chriſt in due time: namely ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and inward comfort.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The people of God are ſanctified in a way of believing on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: they that do believe in Chriſt are ſanctified; they do lead an holy life, dying unto ſin, and living unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:192038:70"/>they are delivered from the ſervitude unto ſin, and do become ſervants of God: indeed this cannot be made evident by experience to the world, becauſe the world cannot certainly know, that thoſe that profeſs faith in Chriſt, have it in reality; nor that thoſe that ſeem to live an holy life, do ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; yet there is that which falls under the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the world, that may conſiderably help forward their ſatisfaction in this particular.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Among thoſe that do profeſs to believe in Chriſt, there are many that live in ſuch a manner, that there is not evidence that they are not ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; 'tis not ſo with all thoſe that profeſs to believe in Chriſt, there are many that make ſuch a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that have no faith: and therefore it is no wonder if they be not ſanctified: but there be many, in whoſe lives there is no evidence that they are deſtitute of holineſs: no man can juſtly charge them with living in any known ſin: with any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortifyed corruption, or acting from a corrupt prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciple in religion: but this cannot be ſaid concerning others that do not make this profeſſion, moral men among the Heathens, <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Jews;</hi> there are few or none of them, but would make it evident to a man of a diſcerning ſpirit, that was familiarly acquainted with them, that they were under the, rule and power of ſome luſt,</item>
                     <item>2. Among thoſe that profeſs to believe in Chriſt there are many men in whom there are very ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidences that they lead an holy life: they do not only walk inoffenſively in their converſation, but there is a great deal of the breathings of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of holineſs in them; their carriage ſavours of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:192038:71"/>the fear of God, love to God, ſubmiſſion to the <hi>will</hi> of God, care of the advancement of the glory of God: there carriage has a great reliſh of piety and holineſs: there is as much appearance of holineſs as can ordinarily be expected from men that have ſtill a principle of corruption remaining in them.</item>
                     <item>3. Many of thoſe who has formerly lived a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt life, when once they are in appearance brought home to Chriſt, do give great evidences of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, many that live among the people of God: do live very corruptly, but when once ſuch men come to embrace the Goſpel in appearance, many of them do become very exemplary in holineſs, caſt off all their former ways of ſin, and live an humble, ſpiritual, obedient life as far as man can judge:</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>But there are two wayes whereby the truth of this is evident above exception.</p>
                  <p>One is by the teſtimony of Gods Word; the Scripture does commonly give the title of Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to believers, hence that title of Saints in Chriſt Jeſus is given to the <hi>Church at Philippi,</hi> 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. ſo they are called holy brethren, that are partakers of the heavenly calling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. and Saints, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Chriſt Jeſus, are uſed as terms equivalent, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.1. all thoſe that are implanted into Chriſt, do crucifie their corruptions, <hi>Gal</hi> 5.24. hence good works are a demonſtration of the truth of Faith, James 2.18.</p>
                  <p>Another way whereby it is made evident, is by the experience of many ſaints: hereby it is made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to them, though not unto the world: every
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:192038:71"/>believer has experience of a great change in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though they have many fears whether it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a life of holineſs that they live, it is exerciſing unto them whether they go beyond hypocrites, and are acted by any higher principles than ſelf-love and confcience: yet there be ſeveral that at times do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently ſee a ſpirit of holineſs working in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: ſo that their conſciences do bear witneſs that they are the children of God: beſides what they do perceive of a daily bent of heart to keep Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; there are at times more viſible and ſenſible actings of grace: there are times when the ſtrings are wound up to the height, when grace breaks forth as the light: and the heart is ſatisfied in that; that he has a ſpirit of holineſs, <hi>John</hi> 21.17. <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee: Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I was alſo upright before him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this fanctification which the people of God have, they have in a way of believing: ſome take ſanctification ſo largely, as to comprehend the work of regeneration: and count regeneration alſo an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of cloſing with Chriſt: but I will not now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs that controverſy; though there is no doubt but regeneration is the fruit of Chriſts purchaſe: but I take ſanctification for that work of Gods ſpirit, whereby he does more and more purge away the remainders of ſin, and carry on the work of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the hearts of his people, and this is the fruit of faith in Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>they are ſanctified by faith that is in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me;</hi> and this ſanctification comes from Chriſts purchaſe, he has by his death redemed us from the power of ſin, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2 4. <hi>who gave himſelf for us, that he might
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:192038:72"/>redeem us from all iniquity, and puriſie to himſelf a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, zealous of good works</hi> ſo John 17.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2, The people of God have inward ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in a way of believing in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt? it is very true, that many men that do not profeſs the true religion, and many others that tho they do profeſs the true religion, yet do not in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity embrace it, have much inward comfort under an expectation of bleſſedneſs hereafter: but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God that do believe in Jeſus Chriſt, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort in that way peculiar to themſelves:</p>
                  <p>Which we may conſider under theſe two heads of peace of conſcience and communion with God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The people of God in a way of believing, have peace of conſcience: and this is not a particular priviledge of ſome believers, but a bleſſing that all do in ſome degree partake of: thoſe men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their coming to Chriſt, were under the terrors of an evil conſcience, conſcience was terrifying of them, and binding them over to eternal judgement, do upon their cloſing with Chriſt, enjoy a tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mind, and inward peace.</p>
                  <p>Indeed this peace may be interrupted and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe of darkneſs and temptations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe conſcience is but in part ſatisfyed: but they are never brought back to take up ſuch concluſions, againſt themſelves as before their cloſing with Chriſt, but commonly they do enjoy ſome comfortable ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of heart: <hi>have the anſwer of a good conſcience by the reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. this comes to paſs by theſe two things.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:192038:72"/>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. When a ſoul comes to Chriſt, the ſoul is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that there is peace with God, to be obtained in a way of coming to Chriſt, that there is ſafety in coming to Chriſt: the inward call of the Goſpel ſatisfies the ſoul that there is ſalvation in Chriſt for all that come to him: conſcience is thereby well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the ſufficiency of Chriſt, the freeneſs and the fulneſs of the grace of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>to him that believes, Chriſt is precious:</hi> the objections of the heart are removed by the convincing work of the Spirit.</item>
                     <item>2. The firſt act of cloſing with Chriſt is not ſo ſenſibly done, but that he does take ſome notice of it: ſome after acts of faith may be more plain, and in continuance of time the ſoul may loſe the exact knowledge of the time of his firſt cloſing with <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the circumſtances of it: but this firſt cloſing with Chriſt is not ſo ſecret a thing, but that it falls under the obſervation of conſcience, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This is clear For,
<list>
                        <item>1. The act it ſelf is very obſervable: when the ſoul comes at firſt to cloſe with Chriſt, there is a weighty change wrought in it, it is a thing quite contrary to what he has been doing; he has been reaſoning againſt it, making objections, ſtanding out againſt all the pleadings of God with him, but now when he cloſes with Chriſt, he lets fall all his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and gives entertainment unto Chriſt, before he deſpiſed him, now he prizes him, before argn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did not ſink into him, now they do, now he makes Chriſt well-come: this is exceeding remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, eaſy to be obſerved, this carriage of the ſoul is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:192038:73"/>ſet forth in Scripture, by opening to Chriſt, coming to him, marrying of him, is ſo contrary to his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age immediately before, that it is of eaſy obſervation.</item>
                        <item>2. There is a great ability in conſcience to take notice of the more ſecret ſtirrings of the heart: conſcience has a wonderful quick eye: conſcience is a curious obſerver of mens actions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. the conſcience takes notice of the ſecret windings and turnings of the heart; the deſires, the ends, the thoughts that paſs through him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. by the help of the word, conſcience makes diſcovery of the ſecret thoughts and intents of the heart: there is a wonderful ſharp ſightedneſs in conſcience to diſcover the carriage of the heart.</item>
                        <item>3. Conſcience at this time is more than ordinary exact in taking notice of the carriage of the heart: at other times Conſcience will take notice of ſmall things, but at this time Conſcience does moſt careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve what is done; for Conſcience is now in a bleſſed condition: it is a matter of life and death how he carries now under the call of the Goſpel: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience takes more notice of this than of hundreds of other things; this is a thing that his ſalvation depends upon: Conſcience has been purſuing of the ſinner a great while, telling of him that if he would not cloſe with Chriſt, he was undone, and muſt burn in hell for ever; he has been neglecting to hearken to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and conſcience has given him no reſt; now when he comes to do the thing that conſcience has been ſo long urging him unto; conſcience will take ſpecial notice of that; conſcience will watch like <hi>Benhadads</hi> Servants, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20 33. as a man would much obſerve it when he had compleated a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:192038:74"/>that he had been labouring in many years.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The people of God in a way of believing, have comfortable communion with God: there is a ſtate of communion with God, whereby a believer has a ſtanding intereſt in the favour, power, wiſdom of God, and the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and in all his offices: but beſides this, there is an actual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, which is ſometimes more inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſometimes more ſenſible: ſometimes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God do enjoy glorious actual communion <hi>with</hi> God in this world: this is one of thoſe enjoyments that man fell from by his ſin: and no man in his natural eſtate does enjoy. A carnal man may have many internal diſcoveries of God, and be mightily affected therewith; but they do not properly enjoy any communion with him: but the people of God doe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> the fullnes of this is reſerved in heaven, but there is an inchoation of it here: God had communion with <hi>Abraham</hi> and others of old in a viſible appearance, and now has commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with his Saints, though in a more ſpiritual manner.</p>
                  <p>And there are four particular ways of it, that <hi>I</hi> ſhall mention.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By diſcovering his own glorious nature to them: ſometimes God breaks out of the clouds, and makes a diſcovery of his own glory to the ſoul: he has promiſed to the pure in heart that they ſhall ſee God: and ſometimes he does cauſe his glory to paſs before the ſoul: ſometimes God makes a ſpecial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:192038:75"/>of one of his attributes, and ſometimes of another, of his ſoveraignty, holineſs, mercy, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, <hi>Job.</hi> 42.5, 6. <hi>now mine eye ſeeth thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>we all with open face behold as in a graſs the glory of the Lord:</hi> hereby men come to know God, other men have notions of God, but a Saint knows him:</p>
                  <p>And there are two effects of theſe diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>One is a drawing out of the actings of grace, they put new life into the ſoul: they are very quickening and powerful on the heart.</p>
                  <p>The other is, That they enkindle a deſire to know more of God: they make the ſoul long after further acquaintance with God, <hi>to ſee his power and glory, as they have ſeen him in the Sanctuary,</hi> Pſal. 63.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By revealing of Chriſt and goſpel-grace unto the ſoul. God does not only at firſt converſion, but many times after, make a diſcovery of Chriſt, to the ſoul, the Lord ſhews the ſoul the ſafety of this way of ſalvation; Saints long for this: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10 <hi>That I may know him, and the power of his reſurrection:</hi> and God is at times gratifying them: Chriſt is opening this myſtery of the Goſpel unto them; the Lord draws nigh and holds forth the Scepter of mercy, the acceptableneſs of his ſacrifice, the freeneſs of his grace, the wonderfulneſs of his love, the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſalvation in a way of believing: and theſe diſcoveries that the Lord makes of the Goſpel, doe anſwer all the objections of the heart, that though the ſoul was before in an unbelieving frame, he has power to reſiſt no longer: theſe diſcoveries make Chriſt very precious, he eſteems him as one that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:192038:75"/>does indeed ſave from ſin and wrath: theſe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries make the ſoul contented with Chriſt: he ſees he needs nothing but this righteouſneſs to carry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: he has done looking out elſe-where for help, yea he takes delight in this way of ſalvation, it is a way that pleaſes, he counts it glorious, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By promiſes of particular mercies: God does draw nigh to ſome of his people, and by his ſpirit make known unto them that he will beſtow ſome particular mercy upon them: thus he ſometimes promiſes aſſiſtance in their works, recovery from ſickneſs, publick deliverance: of old God has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Prophets made particular promiſes to wicked men, as to <hi>Abab and Jehu:</hi> whether he does any ſuch thing by his ſpirit now to thoſe that are carnal men, is not ſo certain: but undoubtedly he does to ſome Saints: and that in anſwer to their prayers: when they have been begging a mercy for God, he by ſome promiſe gives aſſurance to the ſoul, that the requeſt ſhall be fullfilled.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By witneſſing his love to the ſoul: God does not only help the ſoul to gather it by conſequence, but God by his ſpirit does evidence the ſame to the ſoul: that he may quicken the heart in holineſs, and that he may help the ſoul under temptations and ſinking diſcouragements; or arm him againſt ſome ſpecial conflicts, he gives witneſs to his good eſtate, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. this differs much from thoſe taſts that hypocrites may have; wherein they have ſome ſence of the ſweetneſs that is in promiſes: for this is by way of teſtimony: yea the ſpirit does make it manifeſt at that time that it is his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: and hereby this differs from the deluſions
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:192038:76"/>of Satan: as the Prophets knew it to be the Lord that revealed things unto them: ſo Saints at the time knew it to be the Spirit of God that witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them; they do not need any other help at that time to know it to be the voice of God: they do not need a candle to ſee the Sun: though ſoon after they may have doubts.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have cleared up the aſſumption of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, it remains that ſomewhat be added to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the propoſition, that it muſt needs be ſafe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in that righteouſneſs upon the account of which God does beſtow the beginnings of ſalvation here:</p>
                  <p>And I may evidence that from theſe two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Principle is, That righteouſneſs which does purchaſe any part of the good of the covenant, does purchaſe the whole good of the covenant: by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt believers ſtand already poſſeſſed of ſome part of the good of the covenant: and that righteouſneſs that brought them into the poſſeſſion of that, will in due time bring them into the poſſeſſion of what remains: for that which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes any part of the good of the covenant, muſt needs purchaſe the whole: the condition upon which all the good of the covenant depends was one, ſo that the good of the covenant muſt be wholy purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or wholly forfeited: it could not be in part purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp; in part forfeited; the condition of the covenant of works was perfect righteouſneſs, if that were performed, all the good of the covenant was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, if that were not performed, all the good of the covenant was forfeited, an imperfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would not purchaſe any one good thing mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:192038:76"/>in the covenant: one ſin was ſufficient to break the whole covenant, and expoſe unto death: one ſin would make a courſe of righteouſneſs for many years utterly ineffectual unto the purchaſe of any good, and lay the ſinner open unto the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. whatever was done tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the performance of the condition of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſignified nothing, except the full was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that God required: ſo the condition of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Mediator was perfect obedience to the law of the Mediator, <hi>viz.</hi> perfect obedience to the commands of the law, and perfect bearing of the curſe: 'tis true that the active and paſſive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt have a diſtinct reſpect one of them to the poſſeſſion of good, the other to the removal of evil; the one is meritorious, the other ſatisfactory, one procures the bleſſings promiſed, the other deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from the evils threatned: but yet Chriſt being made under ſuch a covenant, the ſucceſs of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the other, and they are joyntly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the purchaſing cauſe of our ſalvation: and one of them would have had no efficacy at all towards our ſalvation, if not accompanied with the other: ſo that this principle ſtands firm, that that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that does not procure all the good of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, procures none, that righteouſneſs can purchaſe no good for us, that is not ſufficient for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſalvation, that cannot purchaſe the beginnings of ſalvation that does not juſtifie us: ſeeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on the account of Chriſts righteouſneſs we have already the beginnings of ſalvation, that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is ſuffieient for our Juſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>The Second Principle is,</p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:192038:77"/>
                  <p>That God in giving the beginnings of ſalvation in a way of believing in Chriſts righteouſneſs for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, does own that to be the way of ſalvation: God does in this way give ſuch mercies as are evidences of his favour, and ſuch as do accompany ſalvation: he ſubdues ſin, quickens the heart in holineſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his loving kindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And herein God does plainly teſtifie, that this is the way to ſalvation: <hi>and that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt was the procuring cauſe of ſalvation: if the righteouſneſs of Chriſt</hi> were not ſufficient for our ſalvation, God would be angry with us for believing in Chriſts righteouſneſs, we might expect frowns and judgments in this way: but Gods giving the beginnings of ſalvation in this way, does eminently own it to be the way of life: when did God in ſuch a way own men in a way of depending upon their own righteouſneſs or external priviledges? they have ſome common mercies, but none of the beginnings of ſalvation: but the beginings of ſalvation being beſtowed in this way, are an evident ſign of divine approbation of it, God bore witneſs to the Apoſtles preaching this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>by many wonderful ſigns, Heb.</hi> 2.4. and he bears witneſs to thoſe that by ſaith receive this doctrine by wonderful gracious effects in them, he gives the earneſt of heavenly glory: which evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews the efficacy of this righteouſneſs which they truſt in, to accompliſh their ſalvation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1 13, 14. <hi>in whom after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy ſpirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion unto the praiſe of his glory.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But in the Sacraments of the New-Teſtament, we are taught the efficacy of Chriſts righteouſneſs unto ſalvation: God in theſe Sacraments is by ſenſible ſigns teaching of us this truth: ſo that in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments there is a divine teſtimony to this doctrine</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:192038:78"/>
                  <p n="1">1. We are taught the efficacy of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs unto ſalvation, by the ordinance of Baptiſm; as 'tis ſaid of circumciſion, that it was a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith; ſo is baptiſm; the waſhing of water, ſignifies our waſhing in the blood of Chriſt: as the legal waſhings had a reſpect unto the cleanſing away of ſin by Chriſts blood, ſo has our baptiſmal waſhing: this ordinance practiſed firſt by <hi>John,</hi> and afterwards appointed by Chriſt to be a perpetual or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in the goſpel church, is appointed on this deſign to ſtrengthen our Faith in this Doctrine.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. This appears, becauſe by baptiſm is held forth our fellowſhip with Chriſt in his ſufferings, that is ſignified thereby, that we have an intereſt in the vertue of his ſufferings; that his ſufferings are made over unto us, that we do participate in the good and benefit of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 3. <hi>ſo many of us as were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his death;</hi> there was ſealed up unto us the vertue and efficacy of his death: therefore <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>we are ſaid to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him by baptiſm into death:</hi> the like expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you have, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. we are thereby partakers of his ſufferings, as if we our ſelves had ſuffered: and if this be held forth, then our juſtification and reconciliation is held forth: for that is procured by the ſufferings of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Baptiſm is appointed to be a ſeal to this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of faith in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; 'tis a confirmation of this doctrine, and the covenant of God to give ſalvation through faith in Chriſt: and therefore it was <hi>John the Baptiſts manner</hi> before he baptized perſons, <hi>to teach them that they muſt believe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:192038:78"/>on Chriſt,</hi> Acts 19.4, 5. and the Apoſtles and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical men would not baptize any adult perſons, but ſuch as profeſſed to believe on Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 8 36, 37. and indeed when perſons do ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto this ordinance of baptiſm, they do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that doctrine of ſalvation by Chriſt: and therefore in that promiſe which Chriſt puts into the mouths of the Apoſtles, when he ſends them to preach the Goſpel, he makes mention of baptiſm, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>he that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> Baptiſm is mentioned as the evidence of Faith.</item>
                     <item>3. Becauſe Baptiſm repreſents and ſhews forth the waſhing away the guilt of our ſins by the blood of Chriſt. This is held forth in that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>the like figure whereunto even Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us: not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> For the opening of this plead you may mind,
<list>
                           <item>1. That the Ark ſpoken of, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. was a Type of Chriſt; therefore Baptiſm is ſaid to be a like figure: the Ark wherein <hi>Noah's</hi> Family was preſerved in time of the deluge typified our Salvation by the Lord Jeſus: &amp; therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>Noah</hi> by preparing the Ark <hi>became Heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith,</hi> Hebr. 11.7.</item>
                           <item>2. Baptiſm does ſave us, as it is a ſhadow of ſome ſpiritual thing: therefore it is ſaid, the like figure even Baptiſm ſav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>s us: not but that Baptiſm has ſome real influence into ſalvation, as indeed all Ordinances have, ſo the Types of old: but the ſalvation he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to Baptiſm is repreſentative.</item>
                           <pb n="144" facs="tcp:192038:79"/>
                           <item>3. The Salvation repreſented by Baptiſm is the purging of the Conſcience from the guilt of ſin; called the anſwer of a good Conſcience: the waſhing of the body ſignifies the waſhing of the ſoul.</item>
                           <item>4. The reaſon why he aſcribes the anſwer of a good Conſcience to the reſurrection of Chriſt, and not to his death, is becauſe. though his death purchaſed it, yet his reſurrection is the great evidence of the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorineſs of his ſufferings: therefore we are ſaid <hi>to be begotten unto a lively hope thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3.</item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="2">2. We are taught the efficiency of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs unto ſalvation by the Ordinance of the Lords Supper: the Lords Supper was inſtituted by Chriſt immediately before his ſufferings, wherein Bread and Wine in the celebration of that Ordinance are made the ſigns of the body and blood of Chriſt; they are not natural ſigns of any ſuch thing, but have that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication put upon them by Chriſt: and God is teaching us in this Ordinance, that we have falvation through the ſufferings of Chriſt.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. This appears becauſe here the death of Chriſt is repreſented as a violent and penal death: here is a repreſentation of Chriſt crucified: here is not meerly the ſhewing forth of his death, but the manner of his death, to mind us of it, that he died in a way of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment: that he ſuffered that vengeance that was due unto us for our ſins, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.8. <hi>for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Here the death of Chriſt is repreſented as being upon our account, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. <hi>this is my body which is broken for you:</hi> Chriſts death was the payment of our
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:192038:79"/>Debt: we were the principal Debtors, Chriſt was the Surety: our guilt was transferred unto him: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not ſuch ſufferings himſelf, but underwent them as a publick perſon, and therefore by his Sufferings we may be juſtified and ſaved.</item>
                     <item>3. In this Ordinance the death of Chriſt is to be ſhewed forth <hi>till he comes,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. which ſhews that it is ſatisfactory to the juſtice of God: it had not been worth the while to appoint ſigns for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it to the Worlds end, if it had not procured our ſalvation: it had better have been forgotten, if it had not procured our redemption.</item>
                     <item>4. The Wine in the Lords Supper is ſaid to be <hi>his blood of the New-Teſtament,</hi> Mat: 26: 28: why is it ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but that it purchaſes the bleſſings of the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament? the Covenant of Grace is confirmed by the blood of Chriſt: on the ſame account he is called <hi>the Mediator of the New-Covenant or Teſtament,</hi> Hebrews 12: 24.</item>
                     <item>5. His Blood is here repreſented, as <hi>ſhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins,</hi> Mat: 26: 28: that ſins might be forgiven: and it would never have been thus repreſented if it had not been effectual for this end: his minding us for what purpoſe it was ſhed ſhews that the end is thereby attained.</item>
                     <item>6. In this Ordinance we are invited to put our truſt in the death of Chriſt, <hi>Mat:</hi> 26: 26, 27: <hi>take, eat, this is my body, and drink ye all of it:</hi> when the body feeds upon the Sacramental Bread and Wine, the Soul is to do that which anſwers unto it: the Soul is to feed upon Chriſt crucified, which is nothing elſe but the acting Faith on him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6 53.</item>

                  <p>Having thus cleared it, that in the Sacraments of the New-Teſtament, we are taught the efficacy of Chriſts Righteouſneſs unto Salvation; it remains that we add ſomething to ſhew the evidence that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from hence, that it is ſafe appearing in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt: and Gods teaching of us, this makes it evident, what way ſoever God teaches it in: but there is ſome peculiar light that does ariſe from this way of teaching by the Sacraments of the New-Teſtament, that may help more abundantly to ſatisfie our hearts in this Truth.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. If God teach us this in the Sacraments of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> this ſhews that it lies much upon the heart of God to ſtrengthen our Faith in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that it is ſafe appearing before God in Chriſts Righteouſneſs: this ſhews that God is very careful that we may believe in Chriſt, if we ſee a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe another an Eſtate, make an inſtrument of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſets his hand, and adds his Seal to it, we conclude that he deſires to give him all manner of aſſurance, and would leave no room for doubting: ſo when we ſee God ſending his ſervants to witneſs in his Name, that there is ſalvation in Chriſt; that he gives it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand, has left it upon Record in his Word, and adds alſo ſenſible ſigns for the eſtabliſhment of our Faith, we may conclude that God is very careful to leave no room for doubting in this particular: his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to put the thing out of all queſtion: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God would never thus buſie himſelf to delude us, nor take ſuch care to ſatisfie us in this particular, but that this is the very way of Salvation.</item>
                     <item>2. If this be the thing that God teaches us in the Sacraments of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> then there are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:192038:80"/>Ordinances founded upon this Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through the blood of Chriſt: this Doctrine is the foundation that theſe Ordinances are built upon: the deſign of theſe holy Ordinances is to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to us of our Redemption and Salvation by the blood of Chriſt: and indeed the Ordinance of the Miniſtry is founded upon the ſame bottom: if this Doctrine were not true, there had been no occaſion for theſe Ordinances; as it was with the Sacraments of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> they were ſeals of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith; ſo are the Sacraments of the <hi>New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament:</hi> and certain it is, that all the Ordinances of God are built upon realities: who can imagine that God would appoint any Ordinance, that ſhould be like the ſtock, that is the graven Image, <hi>a Doctrine of Vanities,</hi> Jer. 10.8. God delights in no Worſhip but what has a good foundation; in the Sacraments God requires us to worſhip him, in a religious attendance upon him while he is teaching us this Doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the righteouſneſs and blood of Chriſt: in the Sacraments God requires us to worſhip him in a religious acknowledgment of the truth of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and this would never be if the Doctrine were not infallibly true: God needs no ſuch Worſhip as is not built upon a real foundation, it is not ſuitable to give him any Worſhip, that is not built upon realities, God would never accept any ſuch honour as this from us, much leſs require us to give it him; if this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation by the blood of Chriſt were not true: to deny the Doctrine of Salvation by the blood of Chriſt is to make the Sacrament a meer mockery: in the Sacrament God does by ſacred Ordinances wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the ſalvation of Believers; and he will never prophane his own Ordinances by failing in the performance of that promiſe: theſe Sacraments being
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:192038:81"/>Ordinances appointed of God to teach us this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſalvation by Chriſts blood, we are thereby warranted to pray for a bleſſing upon them, for the furtherance of our ſpiritual and eternal good: but this we might not do, if the Doctrine held forth by them were not true: the Sacraments being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to teſtifie this Doctrine to us; we have a warrant in the celebration of them and at other times to praiſe and bleſs the Lord for ſending Chriſt Jeſus to work out ſalvation for us: but certainly if this Doctrine were not true, there would be no reaſon for us ſo to do, neither would the Lord accept of ſuch praiſes: if there were not certain ſalvation to be had by Chriſt, no man alive can give a reaſon of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sacraments, nor ſalve the honour of God who has appointed them to teach us this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſalvation by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>There be two things principally that may be objected againſt this Doctrine:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That Faith is ſaid to be imputed for righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 4.3, 21, 22. Gen. 15.5, 6. to which it may be added, <hi>that Faith under the Goſpel comes in the room of works that were required under the Law: hence Faith and Works are ſo often oppoſed by the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>in the matter of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Rom. 3.28.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>That Faith that is imputed to us for righteouſneſs; is believing in Jeſus Chriſt: it is not any act of Faith, nor any other act of juſtifying Faith that is imputed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:192038:81"/>for righteouſneſs but only believing in Chriſt: this is evident, becauſe that is the deſcription of juſtifying Faith in other places of the Scripture; <hi>he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him ſhall have everlaſting life,</hi> John 3 6. this Faith is deſcribed, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>But for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we believe on him, that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead:</hi> here this Faith is deſcribed;

                        <item>2. The conſideration under which, this is acted on God, that is as having raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead; that is, as having wrought out ſalvation for us by Jeſus Chriſt: it may be objected againſt this interpretation, that this Faith that was imputed for righteouſneſs to <hi>Abraham</hi> is called <hi>a bleſſing God,</hi> Rom. 4.3. and the promiſe that he believed was a promiſe of a numerous poſterity: <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1, 5, 6.</item>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Faith of his did include in it a believing of the promiſed ſeed, and a believing on him: God had before promiſed, <hi>that in him all the families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 12.3. and now he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes him a poſterity like the ſtars in number: and <hi>Abraham</hi> entertains this promiſe as it included in it the promiſed ſeed, and as Chriſt ſays, rejoyced to ſee his <hi>day, and ſaw it, and was glad, Job</hi> 8.56. this was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned unto him for Righteouſneſs, this is plain from Gal. 3.6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith in Jeſus Chriſt does inforeſt us in the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: whoever has this faith has the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: God might have made over this righteouſneſs of Chriſt to us without any condition if he pleaſed, or upon any other, but
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:192038:82"/>faith was ſuitable and God has appointed this to be the way of our partaking in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: and hereby men come to have an intereſt in that: men come to have an intereſt in Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs called gold and white raiment, by buying that of him, that is, by believing on him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. <hi>The righteouſneſs of God is through-Faith in Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.9. ſo that all that have this faith, have the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is very probable that the Apoſtle intends no more, when he ſayes Faith is imputed for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then this, that Believers are reckoned righteous, through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: the phraſe ſeems to import ſomewhat elſe, then if he had ſaid, that their Faith was their righteouſneſs: to be reckoned for righteouſneſs ſeems to note to be accepted in ſtead of perſonal righteouſneſs: and ſo Faith is accepted through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: this is further confirmed from that phraſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>He became heir of the righteouſneſs which is by Faith,</hi> that is, of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, which is applied unto us by Faith: and there is no neceſſity of underſtanding any thing more by that phraſe, <hi>the righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11, 13. but the righteouſneſs which we have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in by Faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet it may be granted without danger, that Faith is our evangelical righteouſneſs, but not our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal righteouſneſs: God has made two covenants with men, the one is the covenant of works, the other the covenant of grace: in the covenant of works perfect holineſs is the condition, that is the righteouſneſs that muſt be fulfilled in order unto life: in the covenant of Grace believing is the condition, and this may be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:192038:82"/>called Goſpel righteouſneſs: becauſe according to the terms of the Goſpel all Believers are declared righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſight of God: and the promiſe of ſalvation is made unto believing: but believing is not our legal righteouſneſs, it does not anſwer the demands of the Law; there is a neceſſity of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt which is legal righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and indeed Faith could not have been the condition of ſalvation, had it not intereſted us in the righteouſneſs of the Law: the covenant of Works and covenant of Grace alſo muſt be fulfilled or we cannot be ſaved: Chriſt fulfilled the covenant of works for us, and gives us Faith in his righteouſneſs, whereby we fulfil the covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whereas it is added to ſtengthen the Objection that Faith under the Goſpel comes in the room of works under the Law; and therefore as works under the Law were to be the matter of juſtification, ſo is Faith under the Goſpel:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Faith does not under the Goſpel properly come in the room of works, for works are neceſſary under the Goſpel unto Juſtification: works are the purchaſing cauſe of life: only God has found out another way of performing thoſe works than the Law ſpeaks of, namely, by a Surety: but yet perfect Obedience is as neceſſary as at firſt, for our Juſtification: the Goſpel does not juſtifie us in any way of contradiction to the Law: works now are the legal condition of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but Faith is the evangelical condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and every Believer does fulfil both thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, one in his Surety, the other in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; Faith is the condition of the covenant of Grace,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:192038:83"/>and Faith intereſts us in the righteouſneſs of Chrſt, whereby the covenant of works is alſo fulfilled: and when the Apoſtle does oppoſe Faith, and the works of the Law, he does not oppoſe Faith to the works of the Law as performed by Chriſt; for they work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for our Juſtification: but he oppoſes it to our works, that our works in obedience to the Law can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver juſtifie us: works under the Law were the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing cauſe of Juſtification, and ſo they are ſtill: works under the Law were the condition of Juſtification and they only: but now they are the legal condition, and Faith is the evangelical condition: Faith is all the condition required to be performed by us in our own perſons.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To the firſt part of the Objection from promiſes of forgiveneſs made to Obedience: I Anſwer,
<list>
                        <item>1. That forgiveneſs is not alwayes taken in Scrp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the act of Juſtification, whereby God does take off the ſentence of eternal condemnation: but many times it is taken for Gods overlooking ſin ſo as not to bring that temporal calamity that he might have done: ſo when God removes a temporal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is ſaid to forgive their ſins, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18. ſo when he forbears to deſtroy a people that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, and only brings ſome leſs judgments on them, he is ſaid to forgive them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.8. <hi>Thou waſt a God that forgaveſt them though thou tookeſt vengeance on their inventions:</hi> Pſal. 78.38. <hi>He forgave their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and deſtroyed them not:</hi> Numb 14.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, I have pardoned according to thy word,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but they ſhall not ſee the Land that I ſware unto their Fathers:</hi> and ſometimes he beſtows this pardon upon them, whom he does not deliver from the ſentence of condemnation, and ſometimes he denies this unto them, whom he does deliver from a ſentence of condemnation: <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſin ſhall not be ſo forgiven but that he muſt dye in the Wilderneſs for his treſpaſs at the waters of <hi>Meribah: Eli</hi> ſhall not be ſo forgiven but that ſore judgment ſhall come upon his Family: the preventing or removing of temporal calamities, whether in ward or outward is called forgiveneſs: and this is the very thing is intended by forgiveneſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:192038:84"/>when God makes promiſes of forgiveneſs unto obedience and reformation: the meaning is, that God will proſper them and bleſs, and not purſue them with Judgments and calamities: this is evident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſometimes God promiſes forgiveneſs to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a way of obedience, it is promiſed as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional bleſſing: ſo in that <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. therefore it does not intend deliverance from eternal condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: for God does not promiſe that as a publick bleſſing, depending upon publick reformation.</item>
                        <item>2. Sometimes when God promiſes forgiveneſs unto Obedience, the meaning is, that if the ſoul do return unto God by a true work of converſion he ſhall be juſtified: when men are converted they are brought into a ſtate of acceptance with God: God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto them: ſo that place is to be underſtood, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.7. <hi>let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him:</hi> Act 3.19. <hi>repent therefore and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted that your ſins may be blotted out:</hi> and the reaſon why God promiſes forgiveneſs upon converſion is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Faith which is the condition of the covenant is included in converſion: converted perſons have Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</item>
                        <item>3. Sometimes when forgiveneſs is promiſed unto particular acts of Obedience, the meaning is that thoſe acts of obedience are a ſign that a man is in a juſtified condition: ſo that is to be underſtood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14. <hi>for if you forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father will forgive you:</hi> and that 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>if we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive our ſins:</hi> theſe things are not the condition of forgiveneſs, much leſs the meritorious cauſe of forgiveneſs: but they are a ſign that a man is ſuch an one, to whom the promiſe of forgiveneſs does belong: ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one upright act of obedience is a ſign that a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:192038:84"/>mans ſins are forgiven and ſhall be forgiven in the day of Judgment: becauſe they are things that do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Faith in Chriſt, though they have no influence unto juſtification.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the ſecond part of the Objection that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Salvation are made to Obedience:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer,</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That the promiſes of eternal life are not made unto obedience as that which does merit eternal life: and therefore the beſt of Gods ſervants do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg themſelves unworthy of any good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>They ſhall walk with me in white for they are worthy,</hi> Luk. 21.36. <hi>Watch ye therefore and pray alwayes, that ye may be counted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of man:</hi> but the word <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> rendred worthy, often ſignifies no more than conveniency and ſuitableneſs: ſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1. <hi>walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called:</hi> but the obedience of the people of God cannot merit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life: there are two wayes of meriting, neither of which can belong to the obedience of the Saints: one is when men do merit a reward from abſolute juſtice, from the meer dignity of the work: in this ſence one man can merit from another, but no man from God: for whatever man does for God is but a due Debt: and becauſe no man can do any good but by the grace of God, the work it ſelf is the gift of God: there is another way of meriting, and that is according to the tenour of the Law: when man keeps the Law he does deſerve a recompence according to the tenor of it: thus Jeſus Chriſt has merited life for us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. he has <hi>purchaſed</hi> the heavenly poſſeſſion, ſo the Angels
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:192038:85"/>merited bleſſedneſs for themſelves: but the Obedience of the Saints is not meritorious in this ſenſe: becauſe it fails of legal exactneſs: there be many ſins mixed with their obedience, and their beſt obedience is very imperfect and polluted: and indeed it is upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Chriſt that the obedience of the Saints is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>We offer Sacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The promiſes of eternal life are not made to obedience as the proper condition of it: becauſe God is abſolutely engaged to beſtow eternal life upon Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: every Believer has already performed the condition of the Covenant; and is under an abſolute promiſe of life, <hi>John</hi> 1 2. <hi>This is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even eternal life:</hi> and obedience is promiſed to them, therefore cannot be properly a condition.</item>
                        <item>3. The promiſes of eternal life are made unto obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as the ſign of it: obedience is an evidence that a man is an heir of eternal life; good works do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that a man is one that ſhall be ſaved: obedience is an evidence of the love of God, it is from love that a man is enabled to live a life of obedience; and they are an evidence that a man is a believer: where there is obedience, there is Faith alſo: men are ſanctified by Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18.</item>
                        <item>4. The promiſes of eternal life are made to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as wherein God has appointed to lead men to it: God has purpoſed to lead men in a way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto happineſs, and wherever he begins to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men from ſin here, to deliver them perfectly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: this is the order wherein God has appointed to beſtow ſalvation, firſt to ſanctifie and then to glorifie:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:192038:85"/>God has appointed to prepare all thoſe for glory here that he does intend to beſtow it upon hereafter; he prepares them here for that holy place, for that holy company, for that holy work that is there, though they ſhall be more fully prepared at the time of their diſſolution: this is the method that God has deſigned to ſave men in, that they ſhall have <hi>their fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life,</hi> Rom. 6.27.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. To the third part of the Objection, that Glory is called the reward of Obedience:</p>

                     <item>1. That when Heaven is called a recompence, the word is not taken for that which is deſerved; there is a plain difference in the way wherein God inflicts death and beſtows life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 23. <hi>the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lord.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Heaven is not properly beſtowed upon the Saints upon the account of their obedience as the condition of it: it is upon the account of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt as the meritorious cauſe, and upon the account of their Faith as the condition of it: their obedience is indeed the way wherein they do receive it, and ſo it is a recompence of it: they have heaven in a way of obedience, and heaven will make an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant recompence for all their labour and travail: the people of God take pains, undergo hardſhips, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo many temptations and conflicts in a way of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but heaven will make amends for all, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly recompence all their trouble in the way of ſerving God: at the end of their journey they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive heaven, and that will make amends for all their trouble.</item>

                     <item>3. Saints when they go to heaven ſhall receive a recompence on the account of their good works: their good works are the condition of an additional glory: the eſſential glory of heaven is given on the account of Chriſts purchaſe: and that God has promiſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow in a way of obedience: but beſides thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, there are others wherein God has engaged further degrees of glory upon condition of obedience: there will be a gracious reward by the covenant of grace given to every act of obedience performed by the Saints, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> God will take an account of all the good works of his Saints, and recompence eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one: ſo that the more any Saint does for God the more glory ſhall be beſtowed upon him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.17. and hence it is, as one Saint does more for God than another, ſo the glory of one ſhall exceed the glory of another: God will not overlook any thing that is done by his people: though the obedience of the Saints be imperfect, yet it is capable of being rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the covenant of grace: it is not properly the condition of enjoying heaven, but it is the condition of enjoying further degrees of glory in heaven.</item>

                     <item>1. They that ſeek ſalvation by their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, do not expect ſalvation from the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, as it requires perfect obedience in order unto life: they dare not adventure their ſouls on the ſtrictneſs of the Law: though they had need to do ſo, if they ſeek life by their own works: but they do not thus; they look upon their righteouſneſs as that which will allay the Anger of God; and be an inducement unto God to ſave them, that which will win the good-will of God, and draw the heart of God to them: yea they look upon their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as that which will bring God in their debt, that God is beholden to them for their ſervice, yet they do not lay claim to bleſſedneſs by the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law, for they know and confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſinners, they pray for forgiveneſs; <hi>which</hi> things are inconſiſtent with juſtification by their own works: the <hi>Jews</hi> did not ſtand upon a ſtrict cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:192038:88"/>of works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32: <hi>they ſought it as it were by the works of the Law:</hi> but theſe men do make ſuch a mixture of the covenant of works with the covenant of grace, wherein the covenant of works is predominant: they make ſome profeſſion of the Goſpel, and yet adhere to a covenant of works, therefore the Apoſtle tells them; <hi>that if they be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit them nothing, Gal.</hi> 5.2. they made account to have ſome benefit by Chriſt; ſo they made account to have ſome benefit by grace; therefore the Apoſtle tells them, <hi>that whoever of them are juſtified by the Law, are fallen from grace:</hi> they did not pretend to the ſtrictneſs of the Law, but took in Goſpel Principles into their way of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and yet were legal all the while: this makes the Apoſtle diſpute in that manner againſt them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11: <hi>if it be grace, it is no more of works otherwiſe grace is no more grace; but if it be of works, then is is no more grace, otherwiſe work is no more, works:</hi> they mingled grace and works together, they made their own works the foundation of their hopes, and yet took in the plea of Gods grace, and Chriſts Righteouſneſs; they thought their own works did contribute ſomething, and the grace of God through Chriſt would make up their defects.</item>
                     <item>2. The Saints of God have a great deal of a ſelf-righteous ſpirit remaining in them, and men muſt not conclude becauſe they find ſuch workings in their hearts, that they are ſelf-righteous: no doubt many of the <hi>Galatians</hi> that were tainted with the doctrine of the <hi>Legalliſts</hi> were really converted, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14. there was ſomewhat of this ſpirit in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Mat. 19.29. <hi>we have forſaken all, what ſhall we have therefore:</hi> as the people of God are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:192038:88"/>delivered from other corruptions, ſo not from carnal confidence: there is ſuch a ſpirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſometimes prevailing in them: but there is alſo in the Saints an evangelical ſpirit, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>we rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh:</hi> they allow not themſelves to have any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Fleſh.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, take theſe characters of thoſe men that ſeek ſalvation by their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such men as magnifie themſelves by their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and frames: they count highly of themſelves, becauſe of what they do; pride is the very ſpirit of ſelf-righteouſneſs. The ſelf-righteous man ſets a great price upon what he does: he loves to be thinking upon what he has done, how his heart mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſuch a duty, how his affections were drawn out and enlarged in ſuch a prayer, what he has done and ſuffered in the cauſe of God: he loves to chew over duties again, as things that do commend him to God, while another man is magnifying free-grace, and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the ſelf-righteous man is idolizing his own ſervices, falls in love with his own beauty: is taken with his own carriage, and thinks that God and man ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him: he thinks his works do ingratiate him with God: and draw the heart of God towards him, ſo the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. <hi>I faſt twice in the week, and give tithes of all that I poſſeſs:</hi> he minds God of it, what a choice man he was, and thinks that God has not many ſuch ſervants as himſelf: he counts his own righteouſneſs his riches, <hi>Rev:</hi> 3:17. he is rich in prayers, rich in mournings, rich in duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of charity: he is not brought to be poor in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:192038:89"/>ſpirit, he don't ſee himſelf without money and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price, but has a conſiderable eſtate of his own to live upon: he thinks that by his duties he gains ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards the paying for ſalvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7. he places his confidence in thoſe things, and glories in them; as a rich man boaſts of his wealth, ſo he boaſts of his righteouſneſs: and deſpiſes other men, as the Phariſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18, 11. <hi>I am not as other men, or like this Publican:</hi> whereas the ſpirit of a Saint is to glory in the righteouſneſs and ſufferings of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory, ſave in the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Such men make their duties their refuge in time of danger; ſuch men are oftentimes ſcared from a remembrance of their former courſes, and ſence of preſent failings: ſometimes when they hear the threatnings of the Word, ſometimes when it is a time of mortality, ſo when they are ill, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der apprehenſion that dying time is come: and <hi>when</hi> in this fright, they betake themſelves to their own righteouſneſs as their ſtrong-hold: a godly man <hi>makes</hi> his uprightneſs an argument to hope: the ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man makes his duties the foundation of his faith, in a ſtormy time he gets under them for ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, inſtead of getting under the ſhadow of Chriſt; he flies to his own duties, they are his caſtle, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he fortifies himſelf againſt fear, they are his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, where he caſts anchor: from thence he takes his great encouragement.</p>
               <p>This was <hi>Pauls ſheet-anchor</hi> before his converſion, <hi>that he was touching the righteouſneſs of the law blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> Phil. 3.6. the ſelf-righteous man comforts up his heart with this, that ſurely God will have ſome
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:192038:89"/>reſpect unto his pains, his affections, his charity, his ſtrict walking: this is his fort that he retires unto in time of danger: he has not been ſo bad as other men, and he hopes God will not deal in rigour with him: he thinks that his duties do lay ſome engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the love of God, and compaſſion, he hopes his prayers and tears have ſome conſtraining efficacy upon the compaſſionate heart of God.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he thinks that his duties lay ſome bonds upon the juſtice of God, he thinks it equal that he ſhould be ſpared, and that it would be extream ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, for God to caſt him off at laſt, when he has done ſo much for him. Sometimes he thinks his duties have laid a tye upon the faithfulneſs of God, God has made promiſes to them that ſeek, and he claims an intereſt in them; he makes his duties the ſlay of his ſoul, and when conſcience is purſuing of him, he takes ſanctuary here.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such men take their encouragement from their frames and duties to come to Chriſt: many ſelf-righteous men do draw comfort from Chriſt, and they think they have their dependance on <hi>Chriſt:</hi> count themſelves believers, but the comfort they draw from Chriſt is at the ſecond hand; their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement takes its firſt riſe from ſome excellency in themſelves. They would not dare to truſt in Chriſt but under ſuch conſiderations as theſe; that they are reformed, not ſo bad as other men, have love to Chriſt, are ſorrowful for their ſins: have a good affection to Ordinances, and the people of God, ſuch conſiderations do embolden them to come to Chriſt, he thinks if he were ſo bad and ſo bad, <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not accept of him: but it being otherwiſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:192038:90"/>with him he thinks he may venture: he deſires to be better with all his heart, and ſo hopes that it is not preſumption for him to come to Chriſt: finding ſuch frames in his own heart, he thinks that Chriſt does mean him in the invitations of the Goſpel, ſo he makes his own duties a ſtep towards Chriſt, he makes his own gracious frames a preparation to his coming to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He dreſſes up himſelf in his own righteouſneſs; and when he has made himſelf as comely as he can, adventures to caſt himſelf upon Chriſt: he imagines ſomething in himſelf, why God ſhould beſtow the righteouſneſs of Chriſt rather upon him than upon another, whereas a Saint comes to Chriſt meerly upon Goſpel encouragements, from the grace and faithfulneſs of God, and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24, <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Such perſons labour after ſome goodneſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for Chriſt. They are ſtriying after ſome in order to their cloſing with Chriſt, when they are invited to come to Chriſt for ſalvation, they excuſe themſelves, and think they are not good enough yet to come to Chriſt: they think it would be preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to come with ſuch hearts as they have, they think no body ever came to Chriſt that had ſuch hearts: but they think if they were better, they might come; and ſo they are labouring after ſome ſelf-excellency, in order to their cloſing <hi>with</hi> Chriſt, they are purifying themſelves and garniſhing themſelves, that they may be fit to come to Chriſt: they think if their hearts were more broken, they might come: if they had more love to <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:192038:91"/>if they did ſee the real evil of ſin: and ſo they make it their buſineſs to get theſe qualifications: they don't count it their next work to believe: but think they muſt get ſome other ſelf-excellency in order to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: ſo they make it their preſent work to mend their own heart, and ſometimes they think they get a little forward, and then they go backward: juſt like a man that undertakes to empty a fountain, which fills as faſt as he empties, or like one that attempts to fetch a dead body to life; he chafes it and it grows warmer, but is as far from life as ever: ſo thoſe men are ſtriving againſt their dulineſs &amp; hardneſs; they tug with their own hearts to make them better; for he thinks he muſt be better before he believes in Chriſt: whereas a Saint when he finds his heart bad comes to Chriſt to make it better.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are diſcontented if they be not accepted becauſe of their duties: if God don't comfort them, but they are held under terrors, they wonder what the matter is, and ſo likewiſe when God croſſes them in his providences and follow them with afflictions: their hearts are diſcontented, they are heavy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed: they think it ſtrange that their duties are no more regarded: that they ſhould do ſo much and be requited ſo: they lay hard dealing to Gods charge, think it is not equal: they are ready to look upon it to be a piece of cruelty, that God dont help them when they have done ſo much for him: eſpecially if God comforts others that have not been ſo long in a way of Religion, they find peace and communion with God: this makes the heart ſwell; men can't bear it that others ſhould have mercy, and they not a their ſervices make them very diſcontented under Gods healing towards them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.3. <hi>Wherefore have
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:192038:92"/>we faſted ſay they and thou ſeeſt not? wherefore have we afflicted our ſouls and thou takeſt no knowledg?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us conſider what righteouſneſs ſuch men may attain unto, that ſeek ſalvation by their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: and there is no doubt but ſuch men may go a great way in Religion, ſome attain one meaſure and others another: but they may go far, though they fall greatly ſhort of what the leaſt ſaints do attain; yet they are capable of attaining a great deal: they may attain ſo much as to exceed what many ſaints do attain as to the external part of Religion: they may make a glorious ſhew ſo as to gain the approbation and applauſe of the people of God:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take it under theſe three Heads:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. They may attain to as much as any Saint, as to the external part of Religion: all the external acts of holineſs may be done by him that has no principle of holineſs: the external acts of grace may be ſo imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated that no man can diſcern the difference: though ordinarily the converſation of the ſaints be better than the converſation of other men, yet others may attend the external part of godlineſs as much as any ſaint; for 'tis not grace that gives men power to do that which is externally good: nature gives men the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to do the action, and grace gives men power to do it in a right manner, and for a right end: and the corruption in natural men be ſtrong to hinder them from the external acts of Religion, yet that may be over-ruled: natural men have a power to do the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal duty, and they may have a will too through ſome over-ruling conſideration: <hi>Paul</hi> tho a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> may have a blameleſs converſation; tho <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rith</hi> was
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:192038:92"/>not a faithful Prieſt, yet he was a <hi>faithful Witneſs,</hi> Iſai 8.4. many a natural man is of chaſt converſation, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in the uſe of meat and drink, juſt in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with men, charitable to the poor, ſtrict in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sabbath: he may be greatly inſtrumental in promoting the publick good; abound in Faſting and Prayer, fall in with the better party; take much pains for the converſion of others: yea the Apoſtle intimates that <hi>a man may give all his goods to feed the poor, and his body to be burned, and not have charity,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.3. an opinion of merit is ſufficient to make many men give all they have to the poor: and men may ſuffer death in the cauſe of God, that have no grace, either from ſturdineſs of ſpirit: ſome are men of high ſpirits, and count it a diſgrace to them to yield: they ſcorn that others ſhould get the day of them: they will not diſparage themſelves nor humor their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſo as to yield to them: or from confidence of their ſalvation; lotting upon it, that if they dye in ſuch a cauſe, they ſhall ſurely go to heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They may attain unto great religious frames: many carnal men have had very ſtrong pangs of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction their hearts may overflow in a religious way: many that have no principle of grace have had great impreſſions on their hearts from the Word of God, the hearts of natural men have been conſiderably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the wayes of God: the <hi>Gallatians</hi> many of whom <hi>Paul</hi> was afraid of, were formerly greatly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. he that was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to go thorow ſufferings tells Chriſt in a pang, <hi>he will follow him whither ſoever he goes,</hi> Luk. 9.57, 58. <hi>Saul</hi> has a great pang. becauſe <hi>God had wrought ſalvation in Iſrael,</hi> 1 Sam 11.13. <hi>they ſang Gods praiſe that ſoon forgat his works, Pſ</hi> 106.12, 13. men may receive the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:192038:93"/>word with joy, yet not hold out in a day of perſecution? <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21. men may bewail their miſcarriages tho their hearts be not mended, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.21. men may delight in Religion that are not ſincere in it, <hi>Job</hi> 27.9, 10. men may abominate ſome ſins, though none be mortified, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.6, <hi>the Kings word was abominable unto Joab:</hi> men may be full of zeal that are ſtrangers unto Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. theſe pangs and religious frames are nothing elſe but the various workings of an enlightned conſcience and ſelf-love: ſome men are enlightned to ſee their danger in a way of ſin, and the hopes of bleſſedneſs in a way of returning to God: God puts a light into the mind whereby men come to ſee their preſent danger, and hell, and eternity, and wrath ſeem real things unto them: and after a while God gives many of them ſome ſpecial encouragements of the poſſibility of ſalvation: natural men are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under a common conviction of the glory of God: a natural man is capable of ſome diſcoveries that way: and theſe convictions work upon that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principle of ſelf-love: and hence ariſe that fear, joy, hope, thankfulneſs, that many natural men do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: all thoſe religious frames and diſpoſitions that are in natural men, are nothing elſe but the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhapings of ſelf-love: the ſame principle of ſelf-love which made them before to follow the World and their pleaſures, does after conviction make them ſeek after holineſs, Chriſt and ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may continue in the practice of Religion all their dayes: tho many times they do not, but fall away ſometimes to Hereſie, ſometimes to Prophaneſs, and ordinarily if they live long they grow ſapleſs and unſavoury, ſo as to have little reliſh of Religion upon their hearts: and generally thoſe ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls which they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:192038:93"/>have had of the good Word of God, are loſt after a while, ſo as to have no enlivening impreſſion on the heart: theſe affections which ſometime were in them wither away: yet without queſtion many of them do continue in the practice of Religion as long as they live: if they may continue in the practice of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one year, why not ſeven? why not twenty? why not as long as they live? love of credit, a compliance with the cuſtom of the place where they live, the workings of natural conſcience may have ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon them, as to make them continue in the practiſe of Religion: Chriſt indeed ſayes of ſome, <hi>that they believe for a time, and in time of temptation fall away,</hi> Luk. 8.13. but his meaning is, that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo: but experience ſhews that a temporary Faith may live under perſecution: all falſe Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may be called temporary, becauſe it is ſubject to periſh in time: it is not built upon ſuch a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to make it ſtand againſt all temptations: true Faith is built upon firm foundations, the power, mercy and faithfulneſs of God, and the perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt; and in theſe things there is a bottom for Faith in the diſmalleſt times that may come: here is that which will anſwer all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16. but a falſe Faith is built upon fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foundations, the goodneſs of his frames, miſtakes about the love of God, and hence his faith may fail, though I know no condition that a falſe heart can be brought into, except one wherein he may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to believe; he may continue to believe under great afflictions from the hand of God, under great perſecutions from men, in a dying day: indeed if God do diſcover to him what an heart he has, and ſhew him the plague of that, his falſe Faith will die away, for the foundation of it, <hi>ſc</hi> an opinion of his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:192038:94"/>own goodneſs is taken away: but yet even then he may continue in the practice of Religion:</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us conſider what are the temptations that make men ſeek ſalvation by their own righteouſneſs, and certainly they muſt be great temptations that have ſo ſtrong an efficacy upon the hearts of men: godly men have much to do to reſtrain and ſubdue this ſpirit in themſelves, and generally convinced ſinners are mightily carried away with this Spirit: though God do ſo plainly witneſs againſt it in his Word; yet mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of men are ſeeking life in this way; ſo that we may conclude there is ſome ſtrong current that men are carried away with: ſome great intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that men are thus enſnared with, though many are not aware of it, yet there are mighty temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to lead them into this miſtake: and we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to theſe Heads:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The pride of mans heart: fallen man is a proud creature; tho he has ſo much to bring down his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet he is extreamly addicted to magnifie himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 11.12. <hi>vain man would be wiſe, though man be born like a wild Aſſes colt:</hi> ſelf-love which is the very root of original ſin, runs principally in this channel, men are miſerably devoted to this way of ſinning, though men have extreamly debaſed themſelves, and degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves from that excellency which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them, yet they are exceeding prone to ſwell with pride: pride is thought to be the firſt ſin of the devil, and we are ſure there was a great deal of pride in the firſt ſin of man, that temptation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like Gods, knowing good and evil, had a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal influence into the apoſtacy of our firſt Parents: and this ſpirit runs through the life of man, from his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:192038:94"/>child-hood to old age: therefore called <hi>the pride of life,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.16 how many methods have men found out to gratifie their pride: what coſt are men at, what pains do they take, what hazards do they run, that they may ſatisfie this luſt of pride? men are proud of every thing, all natural excellencies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired endowments, external enjoyments are fewel to pride; men are proud of their duties and graces, yea proud of their ſins too: proud of the mercies that God beſtows on them, and proud of the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they have, or have had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pride is deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the heart of man; and hence it is that he is ſo addicted to ſeek ſalvation by his own righteouſneſs: the ſpirit of a ſelf-righteous man is to exalt himſelf: ſetting up a mans own righteouſneſs is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the work of humiliation and the grace of humility: a Phariſaical ſpirit is a proud ſpirit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.14. pride is the reaſon of mens ſetting up their own righteouſneſs; and it has an influence theſe two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Pride makes men deſirous to live upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to be beholden to the grace of God no more than needs muſt: proud man had rather be the author of his own happineſs, than to have it in a way of free gift: moſt men had rather earn their living with their fingers end, than live upon the charity of other men: ſo in this caſe, men had rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with God for heaven upon the account of their own ſervices than be beholden to free grace: it would pleaſe the haughty heart of man exceedingly, to have the honour of ſaving himſelf; that he might have that to boaſt of, that he had heaven as the fruit of his own labours. <hi>Boaſting is excluded by the law of Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27. and therefore the heart don't like
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:192038:95"/>that way: mens ſpirits will very hardly come down to take life as a gift from a provoked God: men can hardly ſtoop to it, to come to the door of mercy, if they can make any other ſhift they will not do it: it is exceeding croſs to fleſh and blood to have nothing of his own to glory in; and to yield himſelf to be a poor, vile and unworthy creature, to be altogether helpleſs in himſelf; man was once ſet out with a good ſtock, and might have earned heaven, and tis very hard to him to yield himſelf a prodigal, he ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks it to come for alms: it would be hard to one eſpecially that has been rich ſo to do: this we may ſee in the Prodigal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.14, 15. <hi>he began to be in want, and went and joyned himſelf to a Citizen of that Countrey:</hi> nothing but extremity would bring down his ſpirit, ſo as to make him return to his Father; he had rather work hard than come a begging to his Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Pride makes men conceited of their own Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proud men are wont to have an high opinion of their own things: they ſet an high rate, on their own excellencies, and ſo do men of their Righteouſneſs; pride makes men unreaſonable in their eſteem of it, they magnifie it beyond all bounds: pride hinders them from paſſing an unpartial judgment upon what they do and are: they think their hearts are a great deal better than they be: when <hi>Hazael</hi> was told what he ſhould afterward do, he anſwers the <hi>Prophet, Is thy Servant a Dog that he ſhould do this thing?</hi> 1 Kings 8.12, 13. they imagine that their corruptions are mortifyed, that they love God and Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. <hi>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet not cleanſed from
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:192038:95"/>their filthineſs:</hi> pride makes them take up a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their own hearts upon ſmall appearances: and when they have only a few pangs of affection, preſently they are conceited that they have ſincere deſires after holineſs and faith: or at leaſt that there is ſuch an inclinableneſs to the ways of God, which will with diligence grow up to be love to God and his Wayes.</p>
               <p>They think they ſhall bring their hearts to it after a while: and are conceited that their ſervices are very pleaſing and acceptable to God, they think there is worthineſs in them, that they deſerve to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: they think they carry it better than others; pride makes men to admire their own excellency: to fall in love with their own beauty, they extol the ſervices that they do, becauſe they are their own: Luke 18.12.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another temptation is that God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does manifeſt and teſtifie his great approbation, of holineſs and obedience, prayer and repentance. God gives great encouragement unto men to walk in ways of holineſs.</p>
               <p>He bears witneſs often to his acceptance of the obedience of his people: God is all along in the Scripture witneſſing the regard that he has unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; ſometimes he tells us that he does delight in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.8. <hi>The prayer of the upright is his delight:</hi> that he loves it, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 11.7. <hi>the Righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs:</hi> that he loveth the Righteous, <hi>Pſa</hi> 146 8. <hi>The Lord loveth the Righteous;</hi> that he is reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſuch as do amend their ways, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.7. <hi>let
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:192038:96"/>him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on him:</hi> and God makes promiſes of all ſorts of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings unto holineſs: of outward bleſſings peace and plenty, and honour and long life; and of ſpiritual mercies, of the manifeſtation of himſelf, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them: and of eternal life; <hi>you have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life, Rom.</hi> 6, 22. men meeting with abundance of ſuch paſſages in the Scripture; are greatly ſtrengthened in their apprehenſions of the efficacy of their own righteouſneſs, to procure their juſtification: ſuch paſſages of Scripture are ſtrained by them, and they grow up thereby into a more eſtabliſhed opinion of their ſafety upon the account of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: meeting with ſuch commendations of the practice of holineſs: they are much confirmed in their carnal confidence, in ſuch ways as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence they think their own righteouſneſs does draw the heart of God unto them, they think that their holineſs does attract the affection and good will of God unto them; they imagine that their holineſs does work them into Gods love: that the beauty of their holineſs does captivate the affections of God, and their cries and carriages do work upon divine compaſſions, and make God willing to beſtow ſalvation upon them: and indeed a ſelf-righteous man doth attribute more to his own righteouſneſs, than a Saint does to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: a godly man neither does nor ought, to make the righteouſneſs of Chriſt the foundation of Gods ſove. Chriſt has purchaſed the favour of God and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with him: but he did not purchaſe the good will and love of God there was no need of purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that.</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:192038:96"/>
               <p>God could love ſinners freely, there was no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of purchaſing that, that was too great a thing to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt procured the effects of Gods love, but not the love it ſelf. Gods love was the cauſe of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not the effect thereof: but the ſelf-righteous man i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magines a vertue in his own righteouſneſs to draw the heart of God to him; and engage the love of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Hence they think their own righteouſneſs does make amends for their miſcarriages: that they have made are atonement for themſelves for their former ſins: they think their repentance makes up that breach that ſin had made, and that out of a reſpect unto that God forgets what they have done amiſs: they imagine that there is a reconciling vertue in their reformations and good ſervices, that they ſatisfie God for what has been paſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And herein they attribute more to their own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience than we ought to do to the active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt: Chriſts active obedience was not ſufficient to ſatisfie for ſin: it purchaſed the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the covenant, but it did not deliver us from the curſe: active obedience to the Law has merit in it, if it be perfect, but it has not any ſatisfying vertue: it is ſomething of another kind that God requires for ſatisfaction: the Law threatens death for ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23, <hi>The wages of ſin is death:</hi> ſo that Chriſts active obedience could not ſatisfie for ſins: if he undertake to ſatisfie for ſins, he muſt bear the puniſhment of death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence they think that out of a reſpect to their own righteouſneſs; and upon the account ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:192038:97"/>God will beſtow ſalvation upon them: they think that this is that which intereſts them, in all the good of the covenant: their own prayers and reformations, and affections and zeal in the cauſe of God is that which makes them heirs of glory, and gives them a title to the eternal inheritance. They look upon their own righteouſneſs as the <hi>price</hi> of heaven, and think they have done ſomething to the earning of glory, they are at work for God, and look upon heaven to be their wages.</p>
               <p>And herein they attribute that to their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that ought to be attributed unto the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt. This was the very deſign of the active obedience of Chriſt, to give us a claim to glory: becauſe we were very unworthy, and could not fulfil the condition of the Law, Jeſus Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook for us, and has performed the righteouſneſs of the Law, and merited eternal life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Another temptation to make men depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own righteouſneſs, and ſeek ſalvation in that way, is the ſeeming excellency of their own righteouſneſs: there is a real excellency in true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, it is the perfection of mans nature; ſin is a vile thing, but holineſs does advance and perfect mans nature; holineſs is the glory of man: <hi>The Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour:</hi> the Righteous are called excellent ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. and though all the righteouſneſs of ſelf-righteous men is but hppocriſie, and therefore an abomination in Gods ſight, yet they themſelves do imagine that <hi>there</hi> is an excellency in it, and from hence they make it
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:192038:97"/>a ground of confidence: imagining an excellency in it, they think God is taken with it, and that it is meritorious; they do from the excellency of their carriage promiſe ſalvation to themſelves.</p>
               <p>And there is a four fold excellency which they are wont to take ſpecial notice of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The moral excellency of their carriage: they count their carriage excellent, becauſe they live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to principles of honeſty, and ſobriety, and piety: they are no Drunkards, nor Oppreſſors, not Railers, nor Sabbath-breakers, nor Swearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they have a good converſation: they do not live a prophane nor ſenſual life: are not blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves by vicious courſes: they have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, lovely and juſtifiable carriage: their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriages are according to principles of reaſon and religion: their behaviour is equal, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; they walk without blame: the Phariſee was lifted up with that he was no Extortioner, unjuſt perſon, nor Adulterer: the young man was taken with that that he had been moral from his youth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19 20. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of that as a thing which men build much upon, that as touching the righteouſneſs of the Law they are blameleſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3:6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The religious affections that they feel work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their hearts,</p>
               <p>Sometimes ſuch men have great affections: they have melting affections under the conſiderations of their ſins, and Gods mercies, outward ſalvation the ſufferings of Chriſt for ſinners, and the like: they have a delight in Ordinances, ſtrong deſires after
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:192038:98"/>Chriſt and holineſs; they have a zeal againſt the ſins of the times, and for the better party: the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is plentiful in inſtances of ſuch affections in unconverted men, as <hi>Saul,</hi> the ſtony-ground hearers, and others, and they count theſe ſincere, and are highly taken with them: they look upon theſe to be the very ſpirits of religion, things which do greatly ingratiate them with God.</p>
               <p>They look upon theſe affections as bleſſed frame, of heart: theſe they think are the things that God does eſpecially delight in: they count theſe heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frames of heart: they are much affected with their affections; now they reckon they have a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table frame of heart to ſpiritual things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The difficulties that they go through in ſerving of God, which raiſes the price of their ſervices, and makes them more available: they mind that they take a great deal of pains in ſerving God, in reading and praying, and taking ſpiritual opportunities, they dont gratifie a ſlothful ſpirit, but are laborious in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they hope God takes notice of that: ſo they are at conſiderable expenſe, they ſpend of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in works of piety and charity: and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count value their duties highly, ſo they are much in faſting. and in that way afflict their bodies, ſo they upon the account of Religion, have diſpleaſed friends, incurred the anger of men, been reproached, born Perſecution: and upon this account they count their ſervices excellent, they think it is no ſmall matter to do what they have done, and are ready to pleaſe themſelves that they have merited highly hereby: <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. <hi>I faſt twice in the week, and give tithes of all that I poſſeſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:192038:98"/>
               <p n="4">4. The ſerviceableneſs of their carriages.</p>
               <p>They by their carriages have done great ſervice, and upon that account they do extol and magnifie them; they have by their charity relieved many a godly man; and by their zeal, counſel, bounty, learning the publick good has been promoted, they have been a means to promote religion in the place where they lived.</p>
               <p>They have put their ſhoulders to the cauſe of God when it needed a lift: they have been peace-makers, they have been ready to forward any good deſigns they have comforted on ourners: they have ſtirred up others to godlineſs, there has been much good promoted by them, they have had an hand in many a good work; and have been inſtruments to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the glory of God in their place: and upon this account they think they have deſerved well: ſuch ſervices are not to be forgotten, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Lord Lord; have we not propheſied in thy name:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there are two things that do conſiderably ſtrenghthen this temptation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That others have a good, and it may be an high opinion of them: they take notice of that that others eſteem them: they paſs currently for Saints where they are known: they have the good word of others, godly men that have a ſpirit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning, do take them for Saints, they have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them into their ſocieties, take delight in their company, entreat their prayers: this greatly eſtabliſhes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:192038:99"/>them in that apprehenſion that they carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves excellently: they think they are not alone in judging ſo of themſelves, but others, wiſe and experienced men judg ſo too: it would ſhake their confidence if others thought them hypocrites: but they perceive that others have no ſuſpicion of them</p>
               <p n="2">2. That their carriages are far better than the carriages of many others: When they compare themſelves with many others, they are hugely tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with themſelves, many others are prophane and vicious, but they are not, they don't lead ſuch lewd lives as others do, yea they carry it better than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Profeſſors, they are more exemplary in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, not carried away ſo with the ſins of the times, more ſtrict in ſanctifying the Sabbath and the like: they are more forward for publick good: not ſo paſſionate, nor ſo covetous, nor ſo haughty, nor ſo complying as many others are: <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. <hi>I am not as other men, nor as this Publican.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth temptation that proves a ſnare to them, is that God owns them in this way: ſince they have reformed their courſe, and taken up the practice of religion, Gods diſpenſations to them are otherwiſe than formerly.</p>
               <p>And this confirms their apprehenſions that God is reconciled unto them that they are taken into his favour, and ſo that their works are taking with God, and prevail for their acceptance with him: they think the providence of God does witneſs for them that their ſervices are of great account, And there are three things in providence that they build upon.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:192038:100"/>
               <p n="1">1. That God proſpers them and ſucceeds them in their occaſions, they thrive in the World more than they did formerly their eſtates are bleſſed, they don't meet with ſuch croſſes in providence as formerly: that promiſe ſeems to be made good unto them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Whatſoever he doth ſhall proſper:</hi> God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſmiles upon them: their cattle increaſe, their trading ſucceeds, and they have credit and good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance among men, they are improved in publick ſervice; and this they attribute to the delight that God takes in their converſation: they look upon this as the fruit of their goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God has given ſome remarkable anſwers to their Prayers: and that not only when they have joyned with others in prayer, but when they have prayed alone, in ſome particular caſe of their own, they have gone before God and poured out their hearts before him, and he has done the thing for them: and granted the deſire of their hearts, and tho there be no evidence of favour meerly in Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which men ask for, <hi>God hears the Ravens that cry,</hi> Pſal. 147.9. and ſometimes he grants mens deſires in judgment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.15. yet theſe men build much on this thing, inaſmuch as God has gratified them in a thing that lay much upon their heart, and did it alſo in anſwer to their prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God does ſometimes draw nigh to them, and quicken and encourage them, when they have been ſerving him: ſometimes when they have been at prayer, God has greatly enlarged their hearts; ſo in hearing of the Word and other Ordinances, their heart does many times melt, God aſſiſts them, and don't leave them to a dry ſapleſs ſpirit in the practiſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:192038:101"/>of Religion, but he warms their hearts, and kindles gracious affections in them, while others are ſleeping in the Houſe of God; their hearts are greatly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with ſpiritual things, and they look upon this as a ſign that their wayes are pleaſing unto God: they count that now they have communion with God, and now and then they have had ſome ſpecial incouraging words ſet home upon their hearts: ſome promiſes have come to them, that have much revived them: and this they think evidences the favour of God, and the excellency of their carriages.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth temptation is, that they don't know any other way to get the favour of God but by their own righteouſneſs: it is a dreadful thing unto them to go without the favour of God: they have had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the dreadfulneſs of Hell; and they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think of being rejected, they would not for a world be caſt away; it is an amazing thing to them to think of dwelling with devouring fire: ſo that they are preſſed in ſpirit if it be poſſible to ſecure their ſalvation, and get as ſtrong and ſure a title to heaven as they can; and they don't know any other way but this, by their own righteouſneſs: there is another way propoſed unto them; they hear often of the way of ſalvation by Chriſt, but it is a meer myſtery unto them: they do not conceive the ſafety that is in this way, their reaſon does not reach it, what ever is ſaid unto them they look upon it unlikely, they are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the juſtice of it, or that God can find in his heart to pardon them in this way: they are full of reaſonings againſt it, tho God teſtifie plainly unto this way of ſalvation, yet they dare not venture it; this way is hidden from them; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt;</hi> hence they dare not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:192038:101"/>give over ſeeking by their own righteouſneſs; and let go their carnal confidencies: 'tis with them as with a man that is falling down ſome ſteep place, or a man that is drowning, they catch hold on a twig, or a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſtick, though it be inſufficient to help them: or as with a Traitor that gets into a Caſtle, becauſe he ſees no other way of preſervation: ſo awakened ſinners are ſeeking by their own righteouſneſs to make their peace, becauſe they know no other way, they dare do no other, tho they have many miſgivings of heart, that all their righteouſneſs will not do, yet they look on this as the moſt probable way, and hence dare not take any other courſe: This appears,
<list>
                     <item>1. Becauſe terrors of Conſcience put them upon their duties: tho afterwards they may find ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, and ſome affections to God and his wayes; yet the firſt thing that ſets them going is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, fear makes them reform and pray, they are ſcared into Religion, they are forced out of theſe ſinful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, and fired out of thoſe wayes of ſin that they were addicted unto: their fear does direct them unto this way as the ſafeſt: if they knew a better way they would not violently purſue this, for there is that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in every man by nature that carries him out ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to ſeek his own happineſs: fear and dread of hell make them do what they do in Religion, <hi>Job</hi> 41.25. <hi>

                     </item>
                     <item>2. They are afraid to ſee the plague of their own hearts; experience witneſſes to this, that they dare not yield themſelves to be ſuch as they are; many a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dare not yield himſelf to be unſound in Religion, to be unconverted; they compaſs ſea and land to ſtrengthen their falſe hopes: and many a man that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:192038:102"/>knows he is unconverted, and has ſome conviction that he muſt ſee the badneſs of his heart before he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and accordingly prayes for it, that God would open his eyes and diſcover it to him, yet all the while he is ſecretly nouriſhing an apprehenſion that his heart is better than it is: he hopes he hates ſin, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires holineſs, that he is ſincerely labouring after the work of humiliation, and he dreads the ſight of his own heart, is very loth to yield it to be ſo bad as it is, and when God forces the conviction on him, it is a terror unto him, he is like a man that deſires that a limb of his body ſhould be cut off for the preſervation of his life, yet when it comes to be done it is a terror to him: ſo a natural man does not ſee the plague of his own heart, nor will he ever ſee it till it be forced upon him.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Let us conſider what confidence ſuch men may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto: And it is plain from the Scripture that ſuch may be very confident of their good eſtate, and future ſalvation: they may be ſtrongly poſſeſſed with it, that they ſhall be ſaved: tho many that are ſeeking life by their own righteouſneſs live in diſmal perplexity, and through fear of death are ſubject to bondage: and others live an unquiet life between hope and fear, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the frames of their hearts are: yet there be thoſe that do attain a very ſtrong confidence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. <hi>there are a generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet not cleanſed from their filthineſs,</hi> Joh. 9.40. <hi>are we blind alſo:</hi> a ſelf-righteous man may be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident than many Saints: and this confidence does ariſe partly from a conceit of the worthineſs of their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: they think that their <hi>carriages</hi> do make up the breach between God &amp; them: &amp; partly from ſigns which are of two ſorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Falſe ſigns, many times men make rules to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:192038:102"/>judg of themſelves by, which are fallacious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, men make a judgment of themſelves by a falſe Standard: they take ſuch to be ſigns of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as may be found in many a man that periſhes; either from their own fancy or the apprehenſions of ſome other men, or from miſtaking ſome other pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, men look upon that to be a ſign, which does not diſtinguiſh an Heir of glory from a child of wrath: it may be of great advantage for Miniſters to lay down ſometimes probable ſigns, but men muſt have a care that they dont draw concluſions from thence: when men try themſelves by falſe ſigns they take a ready courſe to deceive themſelves: thus men do when they conclude from hence, that they pray conſtantly in ſecret, they don't know that they allow themſelves in any known ſin, they aſſociate with the people of God, they are liberal to the poor, they are accounted of by the godly <hi>&amp;c:</hi> that they are in a good eſtate and ſhall be ſaved.</item>
                  <item>2. True ſigns miſapplied: that many times men miſtake in judging of themſelves, tho the rule they go by is good, yet falſely apply it to themſelves, they take that which they find in themſelves to be another thing than it is: the rule is good but the qualification is not found in them: that rule which does indeed condemn them, they do juſtifie themſelves by: ſo they juſtifie themſelves by thoſe ſigns of trial, of love to the Brethren, hatred of ſin, believing in Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding upon ſome miſtakes that it is ſo with them.</item>

               <p n="5">5 Let us conſider how ſuch ſelf-righteous men do hide it from themſelves that they truſt in their own righteouſneſs: for the Scripture does ſo plainly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt juſtification by works, that if they ſaw
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:192038:103"/>that they truſted in their own works, that alone were enough to daſh all their comfort, ſo that there is a neceſſity in places of Goſpel-light, that ſuch men do add this deluſion to the other, to perſwade themſelves that they do not make their own righteouſneſs the foundation of their confidence, hence ſelf-righteous men pleaſe themſelves that they believe in Chriſt, they truſt in their own righteouſneſs, and yet fancy that they truſt in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and this they do by ſuch pretenſes as theſe:
<list>
                     <item>1. They pretend that they don't truſt in their own righteouſneſs, becauſe they are convinced that their own righteouſneſs cannot ſave them: they are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that their own works cannot juſtifie them before God: they think the opinion of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is ſottiſh and irrational, they are ſettled in that Doctrine, that works cannot juſtifie them; but this may be where mens confidence is in their own works; there are none among us that do think that works can ſave them, yet there be multitudes that do put their truſt in their own righteouſneſs: the reaſon of this is becauſe men ſeek ſalvation by mixing the covenant of works and grace together: they reckon that works alone cannot ſave them, yet they reckon that they will contribute much to their ſalvation: they think that works are not ſufficient of themſelves for their ſalvation, but yet they think they have a great ſtroak in their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: they think their works do gain God to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſave them, and that there is ſomewhat of merit in them, yet they judge they will not do alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace and the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. <hi>they ſought it as it were by the works of the Law.</hi>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:192038:105"/>who are deſtitute of that obedience; who neither have nor ever can fullfil the condition of that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: God alſo promiſes ſalvation in the Goſpel to thoſe that are ſincerely godly and righteous, but where does he ſpeak one word of ſaving them upon the account of their own righteouſneſs, or to ſave thoſe that confide in their own righteouſneſs: God is wholly ſilent as to any ſuch promiſe: if there were ſuch a promiſe, there would be a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Faith: but God gives no encouragement unto men to depend upon their own righteouſneſs, which he would certainly do if that were a way of ſafety: for God undertakes in his Word to direct men the right way to heaven, if this way had been right, God would not have neglected to have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſalvation to them in this way; beſides it has bin Gods manner all along to deal with man in the way of a covenant, to that end that men may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to walk in the right way to the obtaining of good: and honour him by exerciſing Faith in his Word: Gods manner is to propoſe conditions to men, and give them aſſurance of the benefit in that way: he never left mankind to gueſs at the way of ſalvation, and to contrive by their own wiſdom a ſuitable way to bring them to heaven, the wiſdom of man is utterly inſufficient to any ſuch work: God knew his own mind, what way pleaſed him, and has bound himſelf unto man in that way: when he firſt made man, he entred into a covenant with him, and when that covenant was broke, he preſently propoſed a new covenant to him: it is no part of the work of man to deviſe a way of his own head to lead to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but to walk in that way that God has preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him: but when men truſt in their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, they go without book, they have no word
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:192038:105"/>from God to warrant their way: they lean unto an invention of their own, this is like the practice of <hi>Jeroboam that kept a Faſt in the moneth that he bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed in his own heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.32, 33. men in this way do venture their ſouls upon a fancy of their <hi>own:</hi> God gives them no aſſurance that he will accept them in that way: men have only their own judgments for it, that this is a way of ſalvation, God has not told them that this way ſatisfies him, and anſwers his expectations, but men gueſs that this way will do, men venture it, as if they were able by their <hi>own</hi> underſtandings to determine what way would pleaſe God: and needed not any revelation in the Word: they ſtay not for a promiſe, but boldly venture upon God without one: what madneſs is to deſert the way that God directs to, and take away of your own, as if you had found out a better way to heaven than God tells you of: you have an imagination that this way will do, but is it not a daring thing, for men to venture the eternal ſtate of their ſouls upon an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination of their own? it is great folly for men to neglect the way wherein they have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and truſt in one wherein they have none: you act in this as if you did not matter, <hi>though</hi> you ſhould periſh; 'tis ſtrange that men ſhould in a matter of ſuch importance, go upon ſuch ſlender ground, if you ſhould be miſtaken in your judgment, what way pleaſes God, your ſouls are loſt: and if you ſhould miſcarry in this way, it would not he ſtrange, for you had no warrant from God for it: you may miſcarry, and God be faithful, God is under no covenant engagements unto you in this way: is it not ſtrange that men ſhould be ſhie and ſcrupulous and afraid to truſt God in ſuch a way wherein they have his ſolemn promiſe, and yet bold and daring to

God has declared againſt that way: it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous thing to truſt in God without his Word, but more preſumptuous to truſt in God againſt his Word: and thus theſe men do: for God in his word has abundantly witneſſed againſt this way: God ſends men word from heaven, that this way by mens own righteouſneſs is inſufficient for ſalvation: he tells us, that that was the reaſon of the miſcarrying of the <hi>Jews, becauſe they ſought as it were by the works of the Law.</hi> Rom. 9.32. he reproves men for conceitedneſs of their own righteouſneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.16. he tells that that if they ſeek Juſtification by the Law, they are fallen from the covenant of grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. he tells them that <hi>no man living can be juſtified by the works of the Law,</hi> Gal, 2 16.

               <p n="3">3. It is againſt the rule of Juſtice for men to be ſaved in that way: it is againſt the juſtice of the Law: the Law puts in an unanſwerable objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſalvation of ſuch men; the law allows the ſalvation of thoſe that believe on Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. it has not a word to gainſay: but it ſtands as a flaming ſword to keep other men out of paradice: in a way of confidence in mans own righteouſneſs, there is no way to reconcile the juſtice of God and mens ſalvation: if men be ſaved in ſuch a way, what will become of the Law, and what will become of the juſtice of God that ſtands engaged to fulfil the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:192038:107"/>Law: what warrant have men to expect ſalvation in ſuch a way, wherein God muſt part with his own glory, before he can beſtow glory upon them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he muſt deny his nature, before he can ſatisfie their expectation; how can men think, that God is ſo in love with their performances, as to pervert Judgment for their ſakes, and pull them into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by force, though the Law does poſſibly declare againſt ſuch proceedings. God would not ſave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers but with the leave of the Law, till care was taken that that might be ſatisfied, and will he ſave theſe men to the overthrow of his Law, and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproach of his juſtice, the righteouſneſs of the Law does not admit of their ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The law requires that the curſe muſt be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſin: the Law pronounceth the ſinners accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Gal</hi> 3.20. <hi>curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, that are written in the book of the Law to do them:</hi> the Law pronounceth the ſinner an heir of death, <hi>Rom</hi> 6.23. and it is a moſt vain imagination, for man to think the Law will take up with obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence inſtead of the ſufferings of death: diſobedience brings the curſe, but obedience cannot remove it; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience would have prevented the curſe, but obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience cannot remove it; the Law makes no mention of obedience for ſatisfaction, obedience is a thing of another kind then the ſatisfaction which the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: the active obedience of Chriſt could not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for our ſins: and how can men think that that obedience which was due to the Law, if we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinned, can ſatisfie for our ſins, that the paying of that natural debt which we were born under, will alſo ſatisfie this new debt which we have contracted by ſin: eſpecially when our obedience is ſo defect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:192038:107"/>that in that we are again deſerving damnation.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:192038:109"/>when with ſome aſſiſtance and ſtrengthening from him, you could provide one for your ſelves: men herein are reproaching of God, as if he had put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to needleſs expence, they are blemiſhing this great work of God as if it were in vain: God has ſet open a fountain to waſh in for ſin and for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but they hope to waſh themſelves clean enough by their own tears; God has ſet up a Ladder whoſe foot ſtands upon the Earth, and whoſe top reacheth unto to Heaven; but they hope to build a Tower, whoſe top ſhall reach to heaven, and climb up that way: God has provided himſelf a Sacrifice: but theſe think they can make attonement themſelves: what do you, but aſperſe and blemiſh the infinite wiſdom of God: as if he took a great deal of care, and were at a great deal of coſt about that that ſignified nothing, and troubled himſelf with vaſt expence to make a way to heaven, when there was a better path before: ſure God who is infinite in wiſdom would not have provided a righteouſneſs for ſinners in Chriſt, if they could provide one for themſelves: this providence of God does ſpeak you to be under a dreadful miſtake, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If there had been a Law given that could have given life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law:</hi> Rom. 8.3, 4 <hi>What the Law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> Gal. 2.16.</p>

This way of ſalvation by mens own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is croſs to Gods deſign: the great deſign of God in pardoning and ſaving of ſinners is to glorifie the riches of his grace, to let the world underſtand what a gracious God he is: God has other methods to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:192038:109"/>his other attributes, by the creation of the world, by his giving of the Law, by eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon wicked men and angels, he glorifies his power, wiſdom, holineſs and juſtice; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe works of God, the pardoning grace of God lay hid: but he has contrived the ſalvation of ſinful man as for the further manifeſtation of his other attributes, ſo in ſpecial to make known the riches of his pardoning and ſaving grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins according to the riches of his grace: <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.7. ſpeaking of the benefits we have by Chriſt, he gives this as the reaſon, <hi>That in the ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us through Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> and this way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt, and a proper means for the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this end: though Chriſt has purchaſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and glory for us, that does not hinder the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Gods grace: for though our pardon and ſalvation, be a due debt in reſpect of Chriſt, yet it is a free gift in reſpect of us: though there be a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe yet not by us, but God ſent his Son to make that purchaſe for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>the gift of God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> but when men ſeeks ſalvation by their own righteouſneſs, they ſeek it in a way directly repugnant to the deſign of God: this is a way to exalt themſelves, and to rob God of his glory: when men truſt in themſelves they glory in themſelves; they boaſt in their own excellency and not in the free grace of God: <hi>for if it be of works then it is no more grace,</hi> Rom. 11.6. the ſelf-rightous man does croſs Gods end, if he ſhould attain Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that way, God would miſs his aim: the ſelf-righteous man takes a courſe to daſh the counſels of God to pieces, and make the deſign that was upon his

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:192038:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>you ſhall find acceptance with the Lord, when touſands ſhall not: try your ſelves by this whither you do believe on Jeſus Chriſt: there be ſome other wayes of trial, from all thoſe things that do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſalvation; but this is the principal way to which indeed all others are reduceable: there be other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties that are evidential of a mans ſafety: but this is the foundation evidence, as that which gives him his right and title to ſalvation, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. <hi>I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to you that believe on the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life:</hi> examin therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you do indeed believe on the Son of God: there be many that <hi>ſay they have Faith,</hi> Jam 2.14. there be many pretenders to Faith: there is as much deceit in the heart about Faith as about any other grace: there are imitations and reſemblances of Faith: ſuch as the Scripture does give the name of Faith unto, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13 <hi>which for a while believe;</hi> all ſorts of men that make proſeſſion of the Doctrine of ſalvation by Chriſt: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane men profeſs this, and ſelf-righteous men profeſs this: men that were never ſenſible that God was indeed angry with them, and men that do imagine that they have pacified him, are both of them pretenders to Faith in Chriſt: men that do indeed truſt in that that they never did much provoke God, and men that truſt in that they have pleaſed him again, do both make profeſſion of their Faith in Chriſt: therefore it ſtands you in hand ſtrictly to examine whether you do indeed believe in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt:</p>

               <p n="1">1. Try your Faith by the foregoing work of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation: there is a preparatory work neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſinners cloſing with Chriſt: this is a work that comes between the reſt of the foul in ſin and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners accepting of Chriſt: men do not immediately ſtep out of a condition of quietneſs in ſin, into a ſtate of ſalvation: a tree muſt firſt be prepared bofore it be laid in the building: the bodies at the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be prepared before life be put into them: ſo the heart of a ſinner muſt be firſt prepared, before it be united unto Chriſt, <hi>Act</hi> 2.37. &amp; 9.4, 5, &amp; 16.29, 30 and hence the call of the Goſpel is particularly dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to them that are prepared: <hi>to ſuch as are a thirſt, Iſai.</hi> 55.1. <hi>to ſuch as are weary and heavy laden,</hi> Mat. 11.28 not but that it is other mens duty alſo to believe: but becauſe it is their next and immediate work to cloſe with Chriſt; whereas it is other mens next work, to come off from the World, and out of themſelves in order to their cloſing with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There are two degrees of this preparation: the firſt is a work of awakening whereby the ſinner is convinced of a preſent neceſſity of peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God; whereby be is put upon a diligent uſe of all means in order to his ſalvation: the other is Humiliation, whereby the ſinner is brought out of himſelf, and off from all his carnal confidences, to yield himſelf a Priſoner to God: until the ſoul be thus humbled he is not capable of Faith: men will not come to Chriſt, till they are convinced of an abſolute neceſſity of Chriſt: men will never take ſalvation as a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:192038:112"/>gift of free grace until they are convinced of the neceſſity of the free grace of God: <hi>they that are whole need not the Phyſitian, but they that are ſick,</hi> Mat. 11.12. and they that conceit themſelves whole, do conceit that they don't need the Phyſitian: men that do not come off from all their own confidences will not put their confidence in Chriſt; and therefore until men have this work of Humiliation God does not open their eyes to ſee the offer of the Goſpel: ſo that whatſoever Faith men have that have not had a work of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their Faith is not of the right kind: for this is the manner of God whenever he has fully prepared a ſoul for Faith by a work of Humiliation, then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Faith: and many times he does it preſently: when he has by the wonderful work of his ſpirit prepared a ſinner for Chriſt, he does beſtow Chriſt upon him: though I dare not ſay there is any direct promiſe made to Humiliation, in the Scripture a man is not an heir of the promiſes till he does believe; yet univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal experience does confirm it: it ſeems to be in this caſe as in the work of nature, when the Child in the womb is prepared for a ſoul, God does alwayes infuſe a ſoul into it, though there be no ſuch promiſe: ſo where the ſinner is prepared for Faith, God does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe that.</p>

                  <p>This appears, becauſe an unregenerate man can't trnly mourn for ſin: from what principle ſhould he do it before he is born again: he may be grieved for it under other conſiderations, as it expoſes him to a great deal of miſery here and hereafter, yea as it is in it ſelf evil; but not as the greateſt evil as it is againſt God: to ſuppoſe that a man can ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely mourn for ſin before his converſion, it is to ſuppoſe him converted, before his converſion, it is in regeneration that all the graces of the Spirit are implanted in the heart: it is then that the heart of ſtone is taken away, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.9. while men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in a ſtate of nature, as they do under this work of humiliation it is abſolutely beyond them to hate ſin or mourn for ſin: nature improved by common

                  <p n="2">2. Humiliation is not a willingneſs to be damned, ſome have thought that to be neceſſary; and that this was humiliation: ſome have thought they have attained to this: and 'tis poſſible that under ſome ſtrong pang, perſons may find ſomewhat of this nature, but certainly they did not know their own hearts in it: neither does God require any ſuch thing of men in order to their coming to Chriſt: indeed it is contrary to nature for men to be willing to be damned: wicked men do act as if they love damnation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.36. <hi>they that hate me love death,</hi> they do ſo interpretatively: but for men directly and underſtandingly to be willing to be damned, is againſt nature: God had planted a principle of ſelf-love in men: whereby they do neceſſarily deſire
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:192038:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>their own happineſs; no perſwaſions can prevail with men not to deſire their own happineſs: we may as ſoon perſwade a ſtone not to be heavy, or the Sun not to ſhine: there is a weight upon the ſoul of every man carrying of it that way; this is implanted by God in the very conſtitution of nature, and remains in man in his corrupt and his renewed eſtate: a man muſt ſhake off his nature before he can ſhake off this deſire: ſelf-love is natural unto man: man is capable of happineſs, and being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it ſtands in need of it: he cannot be ſatisfied until his capacity of happineſs be filled; hence he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and perpetually deſires happineſs: beſides this, it is contrary to Gods command for a man to be willing to be damned, for God has commanded us to ſeek ſalvation, he is often calling upon us to be ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king life, and that with earneſtneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate:</hi> and this ſeeking muſt be with earneſt deſires: and indeed when this work of Humiliation is wrought in the heart: he yields under this encouragement, that there is ſome hope of ſalvation in God: hopes of life in this way, is one of the things that make him lie down at Gods foot: the four leprous men fell unto the Hoſt of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> becauſe that was the moſt likely way for their lives to be preſerved, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7, 4. the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſubmitted to <hi>Ahab</hi> in hope to find favour, 2 <hi>King</hi> 20.31. when the ſoul is humbled, he is as deſirous of ſalvation as ever: and it is the hope of that; that has a great influence into his humiliation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Affirmatively: it is an abſolute ſubmitting of himſelf unto Gods diſpoſal: when humbled, he yields himſelf into the hands of God: and makes an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute reſignation of himſelf unto the will of God; he
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:192038:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>yields himſelf a priſoner: he would have yielded upon terms before, but now he yields abſolutely: as a Rebel, when he ſees himſelf conquered, yields; ſo does the Soul to God.</p>

                        <item>1. He does not ſeek deliverance from himſelf, he yields to God, deſpairing in himſelf: he don't feed himſelf with vain hopes, and carnal confidences any longer: thoſe hopes have all died away? his ſtrong holds that he truſted in, are thrown down: he does not ſtay any longer upon his affections, reformations, victories over corruptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he has no dependance upon any ſtrength of his own, to gain any thing that will commend him to God: he has no dependance on Ordinances, on his own wiſdom to diſcover any way of help: but he throws up all his carnal hopes as vain: and ſubmits himſelf to mercy, <hi>Luk</hi> 15.17.</item>

He leaves off quarrelling with God: before he was humbled, his heart wrought within him: he could not bear the thoughts of it, that God ſhould caſt him off; his heart roſe up againſt God, and he thought he had hard meaſure from God: his ſins were all decreed, he had done what he could, he took great pains, and yet God did not ſhew him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: his heart roſe to think that God ſhould make him to damn him: ſave and pardon others, and reject him: but now his mouth is ſtopt, he is ſilenced, he lets fall all his pleas, yields it to be fair for God to caſt him off: he ſays as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51 4. <hi>againſt thee, thee only have</hi> I <hi>ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight, that thou mayſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and clear when thou judgeſt.</hi>

                  <p>Particularly 1. By giving him experience of the failing of all means: he ſees no other way left, he has been trying to wring himſelf out of the hands of God: he has been turning every way, and refuge fails him: he ſees all his carnal hopes fall flat to the ground: his carnal hopes vaniſh and dye away: he has been waiting for light, and behold obſcurity: he has been trying all concluſions, every way he could devile and think of, turning every ſtone, he hoped by his prayers to make his heart better, and by his faſtings and by his watchfulneſs: ſometimes he thought if he had more terrors that would do, ſometimes if he had more encouragements, then his heart would be better: he has tryed the utmoſt
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:192038:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>of his skill upon his heart; ſometimes he hoped that in time his heart would grow better, ſometimes if he could hear ſuch a Miniſter, ſometimes if he could get ſuch a good book that others had got much good by, then his heart would mend: the ſinner is like a man loſt in the woods, that thinks if he ſteers ſuch a courſe that will bring him to the path, and if that fails, he thinks if he ſteers ſuch a courſe that will do: but at laſt he can contrive no longer but is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt in his own ſence: ſo the ſinner has had many contrivances, but all his projects fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. By convincing of the ſtrictneſs of the Law: this is another thing that helps to make him yield: God convinces him of the rigour and exactneſs of the Law: he imagined before, that his duties would make amends for his ſins, that God would be at peace with him, becauſe of his affections: but God ſhews him
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:192038:116"/>that the Law ſtands for perfect righteouſneſs; the Law muſt be fully ſatisfied, that the Law pronounces a curſe for every ſin: that it can neither be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated nor moderated, but muſt be fulfilled: that the law curſes <hi>every one that continues not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them, gal.</hi> 3.13. and her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. By leaving a hope in the heart that God may yet help him: this conduces much to make the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner yield there is a ſecret hope that God leaves in the heart: that God will have mercy upon him: God leaves an apprehenſion in men of the poſſibility of their ſalvation: if they don't yield, there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain death, but there is ſome hopes that God may ſpare them, they have ſome hopes ariſing from the power of God, he can make dry bones to live: and from the mercy of God, whoſe thoughts are not as mens thoughts, nor his ways as mens ways, but high above them as the heavens are above the earth, that alſo begets ſome hope that there is a way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt: that others have found help; when they have been in ſuch a caſe: that there are promiſes <hi>of taking away the heart of ſtone, Ezek,</hi> 11.19. this hope helps the soul much, in ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By diſcovering his own Soveraignty: men are greatly offended at Gods proceedings and unſatisfied, about his decrees and providences; and this hinders them from ſubmitting unto him: but God by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit lets in ſome diſcovery of his own ſoveraignty: and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:192038:116"/>thereby convinces him, that God does him no wrong: that God may beſtow his grace where he pleaſes: that he has dominion over his creatures: this makes the ſoul confeſs with <hi>Job,</hi> Job 42.2. <hi>I know thou canſt do every thing:</hi> the ſoul ſtanding convinced of theſe things can do no other but yield up himſelf into the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>Before <hi>I</hi> leave this way of trial, <hi>I</hi> ſhall anſwer two ſcruples that may ariſe in the hearts of ſome of the People of God about their Humiliation:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doubt: I</hi> ſear whether <hi>I</hi> had a thorow work of Humiliation: <hi>I</hi> never ſaw ſo much of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my own heart as ſome others do ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>There is no neceſſity of ſeeing all thoſe ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations that are in the heart particularly: there is a great variety as to the particular diſcoveries that God makes to divers men: and one great occaſion of it is, the different temptations that they are under: ſome ſee more of a worldly ſpirit; ſome more of a froward, ſome more of an aſpiring ſpirit: a man may have diſcoveries of his own heart, after he hath been a Saint many years that he never had before: if a man ſee the fountain it is ſufficient, though he do not ſee all thoſe various channels wherein it may run.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is no neceſſity of ſeing particularly their inability to every duty: they muſt feel themſelves ſpiritually dead; they feel themſelves unable to do any thing that is good: but ſome men can ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance more particularly to their inability to this
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:192038:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>and that duty than others can: there are ſome duties that did not come into their thoughts at that time: it is neceſſary they ſhould loſe their ſenſe of their ability to any thing; ſhould not be conceited of any power or ſufficiency: it is not enough for men to ſee that they can do nothing of themſelves: men may ſay that, when they only find need of aſſiſtance, and not of the infuſing of a principle of grace into them: but it is ſufficient if they feel themſelves ſpiritually dead: but there is no neceſſity that at that time they muſt particularly take notice of their inability to love Gods People, to be thankful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though often they do; their thoughts are wont to be fixed at that time on ſuch particulars as they were wont before to pride themſelves moſt in: and ſuch as they have ſpecial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion at that time to think of from what the hear or read.</p>

There is a neceſſity of ſeeing ſo much of his own heart, as to make him deſpair of mending it: to ſee it wholly under the power of ſin: a man may ſee abundance of corruption and wickedneſs in his own heart, and yet be a ſtranger to it: though he ſees a great deal, yet if he imagines that he can cure it: if he have hopes of getting victory over it, he will not be humbled, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.12. <hi>thou art wearied in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy way, yet ſayeſt thou not, there is no hope, thou haſt found the life of thy hand, therefore thou waſt not grîeved:</hi> before he be humbled he muſt ſee himſelf altogether under the power of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7 9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is a neceſſity of ſeeing ſo much, as to ſet him down that God may righteouſly caſt him off: a man may ſee much and yet not yield it, that it is fair for God to reject him: one foundation of quarelling is an opinion of what he is and has been doing: this
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:192038:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>breeds a great deal of wrangling in the heart, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58 3 he is excuſing of himſelf becauſe he would be better, and has taken pains in Gods ſervice; ſo that there is a neceſſity that he ſhould ſee ſo much of his own wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heart as may quite ſilence him: that he may ſee himſelf inexcuſable: that he may not have a word to ſay: but may be ſatisfied in Gods proceeding if he ſhould caſt him off, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doubt.</hi> 2 I fear whither I have had a through work of Humiliation, becauſe I never found ſo much oppoſition to the yielding of my ſelf into Gods hands as ſome others ſpeak of: others have more dreadful riſings of heart, and more horrible ſturdineſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and bore more dreadful terrors before they could be brought to yield, were much longer oppoſing and reſiſting, than it was with me: ſomewhat this way <hi>I</hi> found, but not ſo much as others, and therefore <hi>I</hi> fear whither the work were true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Men have had a great deal more of oppoſition to this work of Humiliation than they take notice off or underſtand: all thoſe methods and wayes that men take to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of their own, are from a ſpirit of oppoſition to this work of Humiliation: all mens endeavours to get any thing to commend them to God, are the workings of this ſpirit: mens flying to refuges of lies, and hiding themſelves in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds of their own righteouſneſs, are becauſe they are not willing to ſubmit to God: all mens ſtrivings to obtain the ſavour of God by their prayers, affections, reformations, are upon this account, that they are not willing to yield themſelves to be loſt: why do men
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:192038:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſtrive to earn their own ſalvation, but becauſe they are unwilling to ſubmit to the meer mercy of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some men are naturally of a more ſtubborn ſpirit than others: and upon that account they feel more dreadful oppoſition: though every natural man is equally under the power of ſin: for they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſo: the diſpoſition to ſin againſt God does neither increaſe nor decreaſe in natural men, though particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar evil diſpoſitions do: yet ſome men by reaſon of their temper are of a more ſtubborn ſpirit: and in other caſes are wont to be more difficult to yield ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God or men than other men, and that is one reaſon why they in this caſe do experience more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a great difference in the riſings of mens hearts againſt yielding to God, from the different manner of Gods diſpenſations, to the ſame under this work: Eſpecially in three things:
<list>
                        <item>1. Some men had abundance more confidence that they were in a good eſtate than ever others did obtain unto: they were ſtrongly perſwaded that they were converted, had had abundance of joy under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of their good condition: and when theſe hopes come to be pulled away from them, it is no wonder that their hearts work exceedingly: they are like the troubled Sea that caſts forth mire and dirt.</item>
                        <item>2. Some men when they are emptied of their own righteouſneſs are left more upon the borders of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair than others are: there is a ſecret hope that God does ſuſtain the hearts of all by; an hope riſing from the power of God, and the deliverance he has wrought for others <hi>&amp;c:</hi> in ſome there is more
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:192038:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>of this hope in others leſs: the more there is of this the more this work of ſubmiſſion is facilitated: an enemy will ſooner yield where he has more hope of mercy than where he has leſs: the leſs hope men have, the more difficult their ſubmiſſion will be: that made the <hi>Syrians</hi> yield becauſe they looked on <hi>the Kings of Iſrael as merciful Kings,</hi> 1 King 20.31.</item>
                        <item>3. God does diſcover his own ſoveraignty ſooner unto ſome than unto others: the conviction of that is the thing that ſilences the heart, and makes it bow: that brought down <hi>Jobs</hi> Spirit, <hi>Job</hi> 42.2, 5 the ſoul will not yield till convinced of this, and God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deal with men variouſly as to this, ſome he convinces ſooner, and thereby prevents much of thoſe ſtubborn workings, that otherwiſe would be.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond way of trial is by the manner of the Souls firſt cloſing with Chriſt: there is a great difference between ſaints and hipocrites in their firſt venturing upon Chriſt: though there be a ſimilitude, yet there is alſo a diſſimilitude: ſome perſons indeed through negligence, loſe the diſtinct remembrance of this, which occaſions much darkneſs afterwards, but a falſe heart does not experience ſuch things in his firſt receiving of the Goſpel as a ſincere heart does: there are ſome things that are common to one and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but there are other things that are peculiar to the people of God: if the manner of their cloſing were the ſame, their Faith would be the ſame: the manner of cloſing is ſuch as doth diſtinguiſh them, and take it up in ſuch particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſoul is aſſured of the truth of the Goſpel by the ſpirit of God: before the Soul was full of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:192038:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>doubts and queſtions, but when he cloſes with Chriſt he is aſſured of the truth of the Goſpel: the reaſon that men do not entertain the truth of the Goſpel is becauſe they are not aſſured of the truth of it, when they believe the truth of it, then it works effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up on them, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>ye received it not as the word of man, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God, which effectually worketh in you that believe:</hi> When the ſoul firſt cloſeth with Chriſt, it is ſatisfied in the truth of the goſpel:</p>
                  <p>In the conſideration of this we may take notice of three things:
<list>
                        <item>1. That at this time the ſoul knows the truth of the goſpel: he had the notion of it before, but now he ſees it to be ſo indeed: it is a real thing unto him; there is a light let into that ſoul diſcovering the truth of the goſpel: the ſoul has not indeed at that time an actual and diſtinct conſideration of all the ſundamental truths of the goſpel, ſo as to yield a particular aſſent to every one of them: but all thoſe foundation truths are radically made known at that time: that is, there is that light put into the ſoul then, that will make him yield an aſſent to all thoſe truths, when he comes to have the actual conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.26. <hi>ye have an unction from the holy One, and know all things:</hi> and at this time the ſoul has the actual conſideration of ſome foundation go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel truths; ſuch as the infinite free mercy of God, the vertue of the blood of Chriſt, or the like; and ſees ſuch things as neither his own reaſon nor Satan could make him to apprehend: and although the ſoul has not the actual conſideration of all foundation, goſpel truths, yet he ſees ſo much at that time as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies him in the truth of the goſpel: for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:192038:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>of th truth of the goſpel does not depend upon the knowledg of all thoſe things which muſt be true, if the goſpel be true: the knowledg of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar goſpel truths may abundantly ſatisfie a mans heart that the goſpel is true, ſo as to encourage him to come to Chriſt: and although the ſoul at that time does not give a particular aſſent to all thoſe goſpel truths, which are the Pillars of our Faith, yet he does reject none: the truth of the goſpel is diſcovered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and that not only in general: that there is ſalvation in Chriſt for them that come unto him: but alſo in particular, there is ſalvation for him, if he will accept of it: he ſees that there is a way of ſalvation for the moſt unworthy: he ſees alſo that this is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God unto him: that there is that preciouſneſs in Chriſt, that freeneſs in Gods grace, that faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Gods Word, that is a ſufficient encouragement unto him to venture his ſoul on Chriſt: his eyes are opened to ſee that there is ſafety for him notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his unworthineſs: he thought he believed the goſpel before, but only did not know that God called him: but now he ſees goſpel principles in ſuch a manner that he is ſatisfied that God called him, and that he may venture upon Chriſt,</item>
                        <item>2. The ſoul has at this time an aſſured knowledg of the truth of the goſpel: it is not an opinion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture ariſing from ſome probable appearances but an aſſurance: therefore they ſay, <hi>we believe and are ſure,</hi> Joh. 6.69. the ſoul ſees that it is certainly ſo: God gives us outwardly great aſſurance of the truth of the goſpel; and at this time the ſoul has inwardly an aſſurance of it: tis very true there is a difference in the meaſure of aſſurance, that one has, and another has: all aſſurance is not in the like degree: we read
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:192038:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſometime in Scripture of an <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.5. <hi>of a full Aſſurance,</hi> Heb. 9.22. <hi>of all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding,</hi> Col. 2.2. this aſſurance in the firſt cloſing with Chriſt, what ever degree it is in, does not remove the habit and principle of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though it does mortifie it in part; that it never recovers its ſtrength again; yet there will be frequent returnings of this ſpirit of doubting; it will attend a Saint leſs or more as long as he lives; and many times in the firſt cloſing with Chriſt the aſſurance is not in ſuch a degree, but that there will be actual doubting, the workings of a ſpirit of fear are not wholly remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſome doubtings and miſgivings of heart are conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with aſſurance: a man may ſee that it muſt needs be ſo, that it can't be otherwiſe; and yet immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately have recoylings of ſpirit: but the aſſurance of the ſoul ſo far prevails over all his doubtings, that he can venture himſelf in the arms of Jeſus Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>3. The ſoul is aſſured at this time by the Spirit of God, that the Goſpel is true: and the meſſages of ſalvation certain. <hi>The comforter ſhall convince of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Joh. 16.10. the Spirit works a principle of faith, and draws it into act: ſanctifies the reaſon and underſtanding: and diſcovers the glorious excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, whereby the heart is aſſured; indeed this aſſurance cannot ariſe from any other cauſe: natural reaſon will not aſſure men of this: for the reaſon of man is miſerably corrupted, and cannot ſee ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned</hi> Indeed natural reaſon from Scripture principles, may ſtrongly argue the truth of this way of ſalvation againſt the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and other
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:192038:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>Hereticks; but natural reaſon can't ſatisfie men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe ſcripture principles: yea though natural reaſon be enlightned by a common work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo as to be greatly affected with the Goſpel for a time, yet it cannot aſſure a man of the truth of it, neither is it poſſible for Satan to work any ſuch aſſurance in men: men are ſometimes afraid whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diſcovery they have had were not the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Devil: but though the Devil may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort falſe hearts, and fill them with joy, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſure men of the truth of the Goſpel: for he can only raiſe thoſe principles that are in men, and not put a new principle of faith in them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is that the truth of the Goſpel is diſcerned: neither can the Devil give a diſcovery to the ſoul of the glorious nature of God, or excellency of Chriſt, ſo as that the heart ſhould truſt him, love him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Satan can make no ſuch diſcoveries to a natural man, as a natural mind is uncapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, ſo that this aſſurance is the peculiar work of the Spirit.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this particular we may conclude the Faith of two ſorts of perſons to be falſe: on this account that they never have been aſſured of the truth of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as are perſwaded of the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel only from tradition: the bottonie of many mens perſwaſions is the profeſſion and judgment of ſuch men among whom they live: this is the doctrine that they have been bred up in, the principle that their Parents have taught them: they abhor to have any thoughts to the contrary, becauſe they have been E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated in this way, upon the ſame ground that a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:192038:121"/>
                     <hi>Mahometan and Papiſt</hi> is tenacious of the religion of his Country: and as the Heathen were wont to ſtick to the religion of their Forefathers, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.11, 14. <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. upon this account many receive the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and this may be a great advantage to men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are brought under means, and are kept from prejudices againſt the Goſpel; and ſo tradition cannot be true faith: men cannot be aſſured of the Goſpel upon this foundation; this can only be the bottom of a ſtrong opinion, and conjecture, not of Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is alſo another ſort, whoſe Faith does appear from hence to be unſound: namely, ſuch who believed that God meant them in the calls of the Goſpel, becauſe they found ſome good affections in themſelves: if their heart had been dead and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury, they could not have thought that God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them: but the foundation of their believing that they were invited, was, they found ſome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in themſelves: but certainly this was built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conjecture, and an opinion of their own: and therefore they could not be aſſured of it: they had no aſſurance that they were called, though they might have a ſtrong confidence, yet they could not be aſſured from thence that they were invited</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the firſt cloſure of the ſoul with Chriſt, the Soul comes to him, meerly upon the incouragement of the call of God in the Goſpel: God invites ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Goſpel, to come to Chriſt, and many ways urgeth them ſo to do: and from thence the ſoul takes its encouragement.</p>
                  <p>There were many other things that encouraged
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:192038:121"/>them before to wait upon God for converting grace, as the power of God; Gods converting of others, his ſtrivings with him by his Spirit, but the thing that is his encouragement to come to Chriſt, is the call of the Goſpel: he ſees his warrant in the call of the Goſpel: the call of the Goſpel is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his faith: that is the reaſon of his faith that God calls him in his Word. The call of God does contain in it ſufficient encouragement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; for therein God ſhews his readineſs to ſave ſinners, therein he ſhews that there is a way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation prepared for them: therein he binds his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to them, and lays bonds upon himſelf to ſave them if they come to Chriſt, and this is the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them to believe, <hi>Acts</hi> 13 48. <hi>they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the Word of the Lord, and as many, for it may be read, ſuch as were ordained to eternal life believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the right underſtanding of this:</p>
                  <p>Conſider 1.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is indifferent with this firſt cloſing with Chriſt, whether the ſoul takes notice of the call to believe as Gods call or Chriſts call: ſome ſouls in their firſt cloſing, take notice that Chriſt calls them: others that God calls them: and it is no material thing which of theſe ways it be: if either the ſoul hear God, or hear Chriſt calling him, the anſwer to that call is true faith: for there is ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for us to come either from the voice of God, or the voice of Chriſt: this is an abundant demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it: that the call of the Goſpel is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times propounded to us in Scripture as the call of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:192038:122"/>it is propounded unto us as the call of Chriſt, <hi>Rev,</hi> 3.18.20. there is this difference between them, that Chriſt calls us by an authority derived from God: God does derive his authority from none: but Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator does derive his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from God: but his authority is a ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. <hi>hear him:</hi> and hence Miniſters may indifferently invite men in the name of God or Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>now then we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no neceſſity that at the time of the ſouls cloſing with Chriſt he ſhould be reading or hearing the call of the Goſpel: it is by thoſe calls, but many times they do not prevail while a man is hearing of them but afterwards: ſometimes it is in the very time of hearing, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.1, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. but it may be as well afterwards: it may be in time of prayer, and often is, or in meditation: God does it for them that wait upon him in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but not always in the time of Ordinances: thus it is with other works of the Spirit, awakening of finners, comforting of Saints and Sinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.29 <hi>be ſaid I will not, but afterwards he repented and went.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There is no neceſſity that this cloſure with Chriſt ſhould be wrought by the letter of the Scriptures: fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is by ſome particular word; but it is many times otherwiſe: ſometimes the thing is urged by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, according to the Scripture, and God makes ſome ſentence that he ſpeaks effectual,</hi> Acts 16.31, 32. <hi>ſo ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in meditation God makes men ſee the general cal of the Goſpel, though no particular place be pitched upon: thus 'tis ſometimes afterwards with Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:192038:122"/>
                  <p n="4">4. There is no neceſſity that the particular word that draws the ſoul to Chriſt, ſhould be in the form of an invitation: it is many times ſo, as by thoſe words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. but it may be by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Goſpel expreſſion; as by thoſe words, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>who bore our ſins in his own body upon the Croſs,</hi> Iſai. 53.6. <hi>he was wounded for our ſins, and bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi> Eph. 5.2. <hi>he hath given himſelf for us an offering and a ſacrifice to</hi> God <hi>of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour:</hi> it may be wrought by any Goſpel precept, promiſe, declaration: God by any ſuch word may let in a light to ſhew the ſoul the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Call.</p>
                  <p>From this particular we may conclude the ſaith of two ſorts of perſons to be falſe:
<list>
                        <item>1. Such as ventured at firſt upon Chriſt from that encouragement that God loved them: they thought that God had a love for them, either from his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward providences, he ſmiled on them in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and bleſſed them, and heard their prayers, or he manifeſted his love to them by reſtraining their corruptions, and keeping of them from ſuch evil practices as others are addicted unto or elſe from ſome inward comfort that God has given them: God gave them ſome inward comfort when they were in a ſad condition, and from thence they conclude the love of God: and ſo are bold to venture themſelves on Jeſus Chriſt: they have had ſome inward joy, and that they make the foundation of their Faith: and ſo they quite prevent Gods order, they get firſt a faith of aſſurance that God loves them, and then they have a ſaith of dependance: but the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:192038:123"/>love of God is not the foundation of our faith, there is no need of knowing that in order to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the love of God is to be cleared up by effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual calling, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10 Gods love to the ſoul is a ſecret, till he does believe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>after ye believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe:</hi> God may reveal the love he has to a man, unto ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the man believes, as the love God had to <hi>Jacoh,</hi> was revealed to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> but not to the man himſelf: Gods particular love is not the foundation of Faith, but the call of the Goſpel.</item>
                        <item>2. Such as ventured firſt upon Chriſt upon that encouragement that they loved God: they found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to God and Chriſt, and that made them think that God meant them in the call of the Goſpel, that made them think that it was not preſumption for them to come to Chriſt that made them think that God would not reject them: their firſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement riſes from themſelves, and then in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary way they take encouragement from the Goſpel: that adds to their encouragement: but this faith is a rotten faith, it has not a right foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſuch a faith may make men live more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table here, but it will deceive them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3:17.</item>
                        <item>3. In the firſt cloſure with Chriſt, there is ſuch a light let into the Soul of the ſinner, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but come to Chriſt: when he does come there is a neceſſity upon him to come: it is thus many times, very remarkable afterwards: but eminently ſo at firſt: before he comes he cannot come, and when he does come, he cannot but come: the ſinner has at that time ſuch a ſupernatural light let into him, that he is under conſtraints to come to Chriſt: all the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:192038:123"/>wit in hell can't perſwade him to ſtay away: where God begins to open the eyes, there may be ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting: but before God has done, the light is ſo full, that the ſoul is carryed captive by it: Miniſters are required to compel men to come in, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23. that is to uſe compelling arguments, ſuch as when God ſets the ſame home will compell men: the light that God puts in to the ſoul at that time is ſuch that he cannot withſtand it: it ſilences all his carnal reaſonings: ſtops his mouth, anſwers his objections, ſo that he cannot ſtand out any longer, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>every one that has been taught, and hath learned of the Father commeth unto me.</hi>

This inward light is ſaid to come with power upon the ſoul: it has a perſwading overcoming po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer with it: it has power to gain the will, and draw the conſent of the heart: the goſpel where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit does inwardly teach, it has a prevailing power: therefore it is called <hi>a rod of ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 110.2. it comes with power upon the heart, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. when God convinces men of the truth of it, it alwayes works effectually upon them, 1 Theſ. 2.13. let but the truth of it ſink into a mans ſoul, and Chriſt will be precious unto him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. the light of the goſpel, turns about the wills of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.</item>

If the ſinner could ſtay away from Chriſt, the corruption of his heart would make him ſtay away from Chriſt: if men were able to ſtay away, they would not be able to come: there is a great deal of oppoſition in the heart of a ſinner to believing in Chriſt, men are as great enemies to the goſpel as they are to the law,: ſinners are dreadful averſe to come to Chriſt: how many objections and cavils have men to keep them from Chriſt: how many by-paths will they turn into before they come to Chriſt: how much ſorrow will they endure before they come to Chriſt? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. and this oppoſition of heart would not ſuffer them to come except they were made to come: if they were nor under a neceſſity of coming they would ſtay away.</item>
                     <item>4. It is againſt nature when men have this inward light let into them to ſtay away from Chriſt: there is a principle put into every man in his firſt creation to ſeek his own happineſs: and however the nature of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:192038:124"/>man be corrupted, yet that principle is not loſt, but remains ſtrong in men: however they miſtake the way, yet the deſire of all men is happineſs: the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil blinds men, and tells one that this is the way, and another that that is the way, but ſtill they are driving an end that deſign, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> and therefore when the Spirit of God ſhews a man, that Chriſt is the way to happineſs, that there is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Chriſt, he cannot but come to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.6.8 <hi>to whom ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of eternal Life.</hi>

                     <item>5. When the ſinner comes at firſt to Chriſt, this inward teaching of the Father works ſuch affections that he cannot but come: when his eyes are opened his affections are ſo wrought upon, that he cannot but come: when he comes out of darkneſs into light, his heart is affected with the ſight of Chriſt, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtay away: there are three affections that are wrought upon: one is hope, he ſees a hope of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs if he comes to Chriſt: he ſees in that way hopes of pardon and glory, <hi>Heb</hi> 6.18. <hi>who are fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope that is ſet before us:</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Love, when the ſoul comes to ſee Jeſus Chriſt offering himſelf, he cannot but love him, and look on this way of ſalvation as a glorious way, he deſpiſed Chriſt before, but now he charges his mind, he prizes him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>to them that believe in Chriſt is precious:</hi> and then it works on fear, he dare not loſe the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: he does not know whether he ſhall have another call; ſo that he dares do no other than take God at his word.</item>

                  <p>Liberty does conſiſt in an indifferency unto contrary Acts or Objects: ſometimes indeed men have ſuch a liberty, but that is peculiar to ſome caſes: liberty is not oppoſed to neceſſity but to force: the will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be force by any external violence, but it may be neceſſitated by reaſon and conviction: natural men ſin voluntarily yet neceſſarily: they reject the Goſpel voluntarily, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. yet neceſſarily, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. Saints in heaven love and ſerve God neceſſarily yet freely: ſo tis here, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi>

                  <p>From this Particular we may conclude the faith of ſuch men to be falſe as have made a faith of their own: convinced ſinners hearing they ſhall certainly be ruined that do not believe in Chriſt, and that they that do believe ſhall be ſaved, ſet themſelves in their own ſtrengths to work their hearts to this duty, and after a while imagine that they have got the victory, and have prevailed over their unbelief, and wrought their hearts unto a cloſure with Chriſt: this Faith is not right: its very true that after a man has been brought in, he may in this way, by Gods aſſiſtance come to perform renewed acts of Faith: but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thus in the firſt cloſure with Chriſt; at firſt God layes a neceſſity upon men, they cannot but come to Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1 19, 20. <hi>what is the exceeding greatneſs if his power to us-ward, who believe, according to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his mighty power which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead:</hi> when the ſinner comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to Chriſt, he is compelled to come, <hi>Luk</hi> 14.23.</p>
                  <p>Before I leave this Particular, I ſhall anſwer two
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:192038:125"/>Doubts in the hearts of ſome Saints from hence:</p>
                  <p>Doubt 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I fear my cloſing with Chriſt is not right, becauſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God let light into me I objected awhile before I yielded: the light did not at firſt overcome me:</hi>

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many times when God comes with that inward call of the Goſpel, he does not at one inſtant let in ſuch light as does overcome all objections: but after God begins to bring the call home to the ſoul, there are ſome ſtruglings of unbelief before he yields: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the light is ſuch that it ſtrikes all objections dead at a blow: ſometimes it anſwers them gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the light breaks in fuller and fuller till at laſt it quite overcomes him, as in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s call.</p>
                  <p>Doubt 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I fear my cloſing was not right, becauſe when I came firſt to Chriſt I had a fear and trembling on my heart: I bad not ſuch full ſatisfaction as ſome have; but crouded through difficulties:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Some have more clear light than others: but every one has ſo much that he cannot but venture: though there be remaining darkneſs yet they have ſo much light as overbears them: that their hearts are carried out to rely on Chriſt, and that is ſufficient, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. <hi>who againſt hope be teved in hope.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. The third way of Trial is by living a life of Faith on Jeſus Chriſt: they that have received Chriſt by Faith, do not ſatisfie themſelves that they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but do from time to time live a life of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on Chriſt: this life <hi>Paul</hi> lived, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live by Faith in the Son of God:</hi> that is the duty of them that have believed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. <hi>I have written to you that have believed on the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the Son of God.</hi> And this is the ſpirit of thoſe that have believed: they live a life of dependance upon Chriſt for every thing, even for outward things, for life, health, peace, liberty, proviſion, protection, for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publick bleſſings, but in ſpecial for Sainctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Acceptance and eternal Salvation.</p>

                  <p>Aſſenting to this Doctrine of ſalvation by Chriſt: the gloriouſneſs of Chriſts perſon and offices, the vertue of his Sacrifice the readineſs of the Lord to

Accepting of Salvation by Chriſt: 'tis offered to him and he receives it: the Believer takes the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with all his heart, while other men ſtand diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whether they may, he boldly runs the venture of it, while others are waiting for more encouragement, and are frighting of themſelves with the reaſonings of their own hearts, he is thankfully accepting of the offer: he ſees a door open and he ventures to go in: carnal reaſon tells him it is dangerous, that he had need be adviſed what he does: but let carnal reaſon ſay what it can he will venture the caſe: he deſerts all other profers, and puts himſelf into this Caſtle and ventures his life in it: he puts to Sea in this Bottom, embarques himſelf here let what ſtorms will come, he parts with all for this Jewel, and has his whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon this: he forſakes all other Lovers and accepts the tenders of Chriſt: carnal reaſon tells him, he will bring himſelf to miſery: but he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to venture it: he relinquiſhes all other hopes, and puts himſelf into the hands of Jeſus Chriſt: he ſayes as <hi>Paul, It is a ſaying worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners:</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. he flees for refuge to Chriſt when conſcience is purſuing of him, thither he betakes himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18 he gets under the ſhadow of Chriſt, and ventures him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon that protection which Chriſt will give him: when he hears what is to be ſaid on all ſides, he makes choice of the offer of Chriſt, and ventures himſelf with him, he refuſes other offers and takes this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Return ye back-ſliding children and I will heal your back-ſliding: behold we come unto thee, thou art the Lord our God.</hi>

Counting this way of ſalvation a glorious way: this way of ſalvation pleaſes God; 'tis a way that he has choſen: and this way pleaſe the believer, he likes it, and is taken with it; it is a glorious way in his eye: he has an high eſteem of this way, he counts it an excellent and glorious way, as it is a way of ſafety, all other ways that men have imagined and deviſed, he deſpiſes them, as deceitful, as meer traps and ſnares for the ſouls of men as ineffectual unto the end propoſed: but his ſoul does magnifie this way as that which does anſwer the end, and will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and bring about that ſalvation, that it is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

In this way the glorious myſtery of the Trinity is made known: in this way the excellent skill and workmanſhip of the Lord is ſeen, in reparing the ruines of Mankind, and raiſing up of man from the gulf of miſery unto the pinnacle of happineſs, in finding out a way to reconcile his own glory, and mans ſalvation; in beſtowing bleſſedneſs upon man, in ſuch a way that free grace ſhall have all the glory; in this way the wonderful love of God does appear: in this coſtly way of ſalvation: upon this account the ſoul is taken with this way of ſalvation, as a way that will much advance the glory of God? we ſhould have been great ſtrangers to God, and have ſeen lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of his glory comparatively, had it not been for this way of ſalvation: it is pleaſant taking notice of the beamings forth of Gods glory in this way, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.13. <hi>bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power be to him that ſitteth on the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>

                  <p>There be many conſiderations which the hearts of believers do pitch upon, which draw forth the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Faith: as the conſiderations that unbelief fixes upon, are very many; only here mind this: that <hi>where</hi> the Lord makes one encouraging conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion powerful upon the heart, it is an in-let to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others.</p>
                  <p>And we may reduce them principally to theſe three Heads,
<list>
                        <item>1. The heart fixes ſometime on the conſideration of Gods mercy: ſaith is drawn forth by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:192038:130"/>of the merciful nature of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.18. <hi>When I ſaid my foot ſlippeth, thy mercy O Lord held me up:</hi> the ſoul ſays God is of infinite mercy, he can find in his heart to blot out greateſt tranſgreſſions; his mercy is greater than our ſinfulneſs: he can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome all our guilt, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. <hi>who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> ſometimes upon the conſideration of the freeneſs of Gods mercy, he has no dependance on our worth: he can give life without any thing in us to draw his heart towards us <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. <hi>grace reigns through righteouſneſs unto eternal life, &amp;c.</hi> ſometimes on the merciful purpoſes of God: who has deſigned to ſhew mercy upon many of the ſinful children of men; he has determined to bring many ſinners unto the enjoyment of himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. ſometimes on the exerciſe of his mercy in ſending his Son to dye for ſinners, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the thoughts pitch on the merciful invitations that the Lord makes to ſinners, 2 <hi>cor.</hi> 5.20. ſomtimes on the exerciſe of his mercy on great ſinners, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalen, Paul</hi> and others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16 ſometimes on the tender love of Chriſt abundantly manifeſted when here on earth, ſometime the ſpirit ſets home one of theſe conſiderations, and ſometime another; which draws the heart to believe, when under the greateſt ſence of vileneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.7. <hi>how excellent is thy loving kindneſs, O God: therefore the children of men put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The heart fixes ſometimes on the conſideration, of Gods ſaithfulneſs: that is a mighty ſtay to the heart when he has a ſpiritual ſight of the faithfulneſs of God: when that is faſtned on the heart, that makes him receive the promiſe, whatever improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility there be in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11. when we have to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:192038:130"/>do with a faithful man, we lay weight upon his word, ſo does the believer on Gods; when this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his faithfulneſs is faſtned on his heart: the ſoul ſays it muſt needs be ſo as God promiſes, for God is a God of Truth, it is impoſſible that God ſhould lye: God cannot miſtake nor deceive: his word is infallible, his promiſe cannot fail: hereby he ſtops the mouth of carnal reaſon: God has promiſed ſo and ſo to us, and promiſed ſo and ſo to Chriſt; and he is not fickle and inconſtant, repentance is hid from his eyes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.9. <hi>if we receive the witneſs of men, the witneſs of God is greater:</hi> why ſhould I fright my ſelf with appearances and uncertain reaſonings, why ſhould I doubt though the things are ſtrange and wonderful? though we can't ſee the reaſon of theſe things: the Word of God cannot fail, we may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture our ſouls on it, if they were more worth than they are, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.</item>
                        <item>3. The heart fixes ſometimes upon the ſufficiency of Chriſt: that comes with mighty power upon the heart; ſtilling accuſations, diſſipating fears, drawing the heart to rejoyce in Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. <hi>that I may know him, and the power of his Reſurrection:</hi> ſomtimes the Lord faſtens it on the heart, that Chriſt is the way that God has appointed unto life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. ſometimes that Chriſt has born our ſins in his own body, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. ſometimes that Juſtice is ſatisfied, the Law fully anſwered by Chriſt: that God may without any injuſtice pardon and ſave, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. that the ſacrifice of Chriſt is acceptable unto God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. that God has fully avenged himſelf on Chriſt, 2 <hi>cor.</hi> 5.21. that Chriſt is our Paſſover, the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world: that all the families of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:192038:131"/>him: that he is our High-prieſt, bearing our names on his breaſt in the moſt holy place: theſe and ſcores of ſuch conſiderations which the Lord at times, faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens on the hearts of his people; do wonderfully help them to caſt themſelves upon Chriſt, giving him the glory of redeeming them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12. <hi>worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive power and riches, and wiſdom and ſtrength, and honour and glory, and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

                  <p>Where he is more clearly ſatisfied in his own good eſtate; there are times when the people of God have very comfor table ſatisfaction that they are in a good condition: they have comfortable hopes that they are in a ſtate of Juſtification, that God has par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned their ſins, and will ſave them; theſe hopes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from a diſcerning of their former actings of faith, their ſanctification, and that joy in the Holy Ghoſt which they have had, and at ſuch times as theſe, they do live a life of Faith upon Chriſt, when they can ſee their ſanctification, they do not build upon that as the matter of their juſtification, neither do they ſo live upon any ſigns, as to lie in the neglect of acting dependance on Chriſt: though there is too much of that Spirit to live upon ſigns, and to neglect Chriſt, yet this Spirit does not rule a Saint: but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his hopes, his venturing himſelf upon the free and gracious offers of the Goſpel, though he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:192038:131"/>finds comfort in thoſe evidences that God gives him of his good eſtate; yet he is from time to time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing his acts of dependance upon Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. I <hi>ſet under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet unto my taſte.</hi>

When he is more in the dark about his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: there are times with many at leaſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, when they are greatly exerciſed with fears, there be many things that give occaſion of fear to them, they are afraid becauſe they ſee great wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of corruptions, cannot diſcern love to God, do not find love to Ordinances, ſeem to grow worſe and worſe: ſo they are afraid, becauſe they nave not ſuch comforts as other chriſtians have: they do not find that preſence of God with them, that they think they ſhould have if they were Saints: many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they meet withal, that ſhake their hopes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: but in this condition they do not neglect to believe in Chriſt, though when they are in the dark, they have great ſtruglings of unbelief: but they do not caſt off their faith in Chriſt: their faith has not dependance upon their ſigns, when ſigns fail, yet the foundation of their faith remains: though they ſee not yet they do believe: at ſuch a time it is their duty to believe: <hi>when they are in darkneſs and have no light, their work is to ſtay on the name of the Lord,</hi> Iſai. 50.10. and this is their ſpirit: <hi>Saints live by faith, and not by ſight,</hi> 2 Cor. 5, 7. and though they are at a loſs what they are, and what they have done, yet they ſee ground of faith in Chriſt: their relyance does not depend upon their aſſurance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.26. <hi>my fleſh and my heart faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart and my portion for ever.</hi>

                  <p>By this way of trial we may conclude againſt three ſorts of perſons, that they have not true Faith.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Such perſons as ſatisfie themſelves that they have believed in Chriſt, and cloſed with him, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time formerly, and don't live in a way of believing they nouriſh an hope, becauſe they have believed at ſuch a time, but neglect to roll themſelves on Chriſt from time to time; ſo it is with ſome dry and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury profeſſors, they have got an hope from ſome old works they had upon their hearts many years ſince, they truſt that that will carry them to heaven, and don't live a life of faith, but live in a wretched neglect of Chriſt: many times ſuch mens religion is quite worn out by that time they grow into years, and they are like ſalt that has loſt its favour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14.</item>
                     <item>2. Such perſons as generally live upon their own righteouſneſs, but only now and then they force themſelves to rely on Chriſt: the general way of their living is upon their good frames and ſervices, but now and then they have a Sermon againſt their truſting in their own righteouſneſs, or it is given as a ſign of an hypocrite to truſt in his own duties, and they ſet themſelves to truſt in Chriſt, and think they do ſomewhat at it: but their way of living is upon themſelves, and they are very great strangers to Chriſt: this is not the guiſe of the people of God, <hi>gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>the life thut I live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. Such perſons as cannot venture upon Chriſt; when they are in the dark about their eſtate: when they think that they ſee ſigns that they are converted,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:192038:132"/>then they can believe, they are very forward; but when in the dark no Goſpel encouragements will prevail upon them: a ſaint may find it very difficult at ſuch a time: but a falſe heart ſtayes till he can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſome more hopes of his good condition before he can believe: ſuch a man does not live a life of Faith.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Before I paſs this way of trial, I ſhall anſwer ſome Doubts about it that ſometimes trouble the People of God.</p>
                  <p>Doubt 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I fear I do not live a life of Faith, becauſe I find abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of unbelief: I am exceeding diſtruſtful: ſee little as I ought to ſee of the excellency of Chriſt, of the ſtability of the Covenant, or of the freeneſs of Gods grace:</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be ſo, and yet your Faith may be right: there is a backwardneſs in Saints to believe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.25, 26. <hi>O fools and ſtow of heart to believe:</hi> Saints have but a little Faith they that have moſt have but a little <hi>Rev</hi> 3.8. this is the general complaint of the people of God, and generally it is from Faith, that they are burdened with unbelief: a ſpirit of Faith makes men qualified to diſcern their unbelief, and makes men ſee an hainous evil in it.</p>
                  <p>Doubt 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I fear I dont live a life of Faith, becauſe I am very ready to give way to a ſpirit of carnal confidence: I am ſure t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>

                  <p>You gain confiderably by your Faith, if you gain this to be kept following of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. you muſt not be diſcouraged, becauſe God does not give you ſuch ſigns as you deſire, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20 29. <hi>Bleſſed are they that have not ſeen and yet have believed:</hi> the meaſures of comfort that God gives to his People are very various, and ſometimes God puts his people upon it, againſt hope, to believe in hope: and that is a ſign of a good Faith, when a man ſees but little coming, and yet will believe ſtill, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Abraham againſt hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in hope.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I am afraid becauſe</hi> I <hi>am ſo bold to truſt in God from time to time though I have ſo much ſin: I am afraid it is a life of Preſumption, not Faith:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is indeed a boldneſs to truſt in God from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of mens worth; that is not right: but there is a two fold boldneſs that God will never blame men for: one is, the bearing up of their heart with the hopes of Gods favour upon good experience of it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſin: only you muſt beware you do not make light of ſin, becauſe God has given you ſuch hopes: the other is, a depending on Jeſus Chriſt for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin; and accepting Gods offer notwithſtand your ſins: yea though you have not ſuch brokenneſs of heart as does become you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Try the truth of your Faith by that holineſs that does accompany and flow from Faith in Jeſus Chriſt: they that are true believers do lead an holy life: Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs does accompany Faith: and therefore believers are commonly in Scripture ſtiled Saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. there is a concatenation of Graces: where there is one grace there is all: as it is in a natural man, all the natural faculties of the ſoul do accompany each other, they live and dye together; ſo it is with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral graces that are in Saints; the ſame principle of Grace does inable the Soul to all ſorts of holy actions; Grace in the heart is but one principle, though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its various actings and objects it does receive various denominations: and wherever Faith is, it is accompanied with univerſal holineſs: and therefore holineſs is given as a Sign and Character of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. they that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts: the actings of Faith go hand in hand with the excerciſe of other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Faith is alwayes attended with univerſal holineſs
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:192038:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>hence there are ſo many promiſes of Salvation made unto thoſe that are holy: though it be Faith only that gives men a title to heaven, yet there are promiſes made unto holineſs becauſe that is a property of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: and hence alſo there are ſo many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings unto thoſe that live unholily, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed holineſs does not only accompany Faith, but the exerciſe of it does flow from Faith, Faith has a great influence into an holy life: the actings of Faith upon the whole Word of God does greatly quicken a ſpirit of obedience: it is a ſpirit of Faith that makes all the Arguments which the Scripture is full of to become powerful upon the heart: whatever God propoſes to us in his Word to make us obedient, it will not have that effect upon our heart if it be not entertained by Faith: men believe commands, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, threatnings, and ſo they become efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous upon the heart: the whole Word of God works on men as it is entertained by Faith, all graces are quickened and drawn into exerciſe in this way: men believe and hope, they believe and love, they believe and repent: the Will and Affections never act in a gracious way, but when the underſtanding does diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ground ſo to do: by Faith we underſtand ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, and ſo our hearts are carried after them; what ever grace is acted Faith is acted together with it: and therefore in the <hi>11th</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Patriarcks</hi> did and ſuffered for God is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Faith.</p>
                  <p>But as other actings of Faith have an influence into Holineſs, ſo in a ſpecial manner the actings of Faith upon Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>we are ſatisfied by Faith in him,</hi> Act. 26.18. the peculiar actings of Faith on Chriſt have a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:192038:134"/>ſpecial influence into an holy life: and that two wayes:
<list>
                        <item>1. The believing of the Goſpel does in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtir up men to holineſs: when men by Faith do entertain the calls of God in the Goſpel, it has a ſtrong impreſſion on their hearts to move them to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: when men ſee the readineſs of God to pardon them, the wonderful grace of God in the Goſpel, it prevails with them to lead an holy life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.23. <hi>Thy loving kindneſs is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth:</hi> the ſence of the grace of God appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Faith, makes men admire the glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God, love God, fear to offend him, troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that they have grieved him and wronged him: the diſcoveries of Goſpel grace leave an everlaſting impreſſion upon the heart, to love and honour God.</item>
                        <item>2. The believing on Chriſt is the way wherein God has promiſed to carry on the work of Sanctification: in this way God gives forth the aſſiſtances of his Spirit for the carrying on of this work: God in the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Goſpel <hi>calls us to glory and vertue,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.3. Faith in Chriſt is the condition of the covenant of grace, and therefore thereby God becomes enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to keep men in the wayes of holineſs, as all other covenant mercies are made over to the ſoul in this way; ſo likewiſe ſanctifying grace, and beſides that God has directed us to exerciſe Faith upon Chriſt for Sanctification; he tells us that <hi>without him we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> John 15.5. that he is made to us <hi>for Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>that whatever we do in word or deed, we muſt do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3.17. this is a principal means preſcribed unto us in order to the carrying on of the work of Sanctification, we muſt attend other appointments and ordinances of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:192038:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>God: prayer, reading, hearing, ſacraments, watching, meditating &amp; <hi>ſim.</hi> but we may not truſt to any of our own ſtrivings: but eſpecially attend this ordinance of the covenant of grace, to roll our ſelves upon Chriſt, as being the purchaſer and the diſpenſer of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, waiting for the influences of his Spirit, and in this way he aſſiſts and ſtrengthens his to lead an holy life.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the opening of this way of Trial, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what an holy life is: It is a courſe of walking in all Gods Commandments from a gracious reſpect unto God: here you may diſtinguiſh between a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of holineſs, an holy frame, an holy action, and an holy life: a principle of holineſs is a quality ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and inclining a man to keep all Gods commands out of a gracious reſpect unto God; an holy frame is a raiſed prevailing diſpoſition unto holineſs, by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit it is diſpoſed to holineſs, by an holy frame to a more ready and chearful practice of holineſs: when the heart is in an holy frame, it is like an inſtrument in tune, like a good knife that has a good edge: an holy action is an action commanded of God, done out of a gracious reſpect unto God: an holy life is a courſe of walking in all Gods commands, from a gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto God:</p>
                  <p>In this diſcription three things are to be minded;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That where there is an holy life, there is a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all Gods commands: there may be a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome particular ſins where there is not an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, any one way of ſin makes a mans life unholy: if men allow any way of diſobedience the life is not holy: in an holy life there is an abſtaining from every known ſin, and the practice of every known duty,

                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 1 6. <hi>They were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs:</hi> he that leads an holy life does obſerve all thoſe commands that direct his outward behaviour of himſelf; and he attends all thoſe commands that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the carriage and behaviour of the heart: thoſe commands that require internal duty, love, fear, and thoſe that do require the right manner of doing his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doing of it for Gods glory, doing of it in the Name of Chriſt, doing of it with diligence, with delight: the caſting off of any duty makes the life unholy.</p>
                  <p>The principle of grace that is in a Saint does both inable and incline the heart to keep all Gods Commands there is no command given by God, but there is a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table inclination in the heart of a Saint unto it: there be in the heart of a Saint ſome general inclinations to all Gods commands: ſome inclinations that reſpect every one of Gods precepts: that are principles of univerſal obedience; and they are three, love to God, fear of God and ſaith in God; theſe three influence a man to all that obedience that God requires; theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the heart to do every thing that God requires: hence ſometimes we read that love makes us keep Gods commands, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. ſo all Religion is called the fear of God; becauſe that influences all, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.10. ſo Faith is a general principle of obedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7, 8. &amp; beſides theſe there are in a godly man more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inclinations to the commands ſeverally: which are not of ſuch latitude, theſe are the off-ſpring of the other: thus patience inclines a man to keep ſome commands, temperance others, bounty others, pity others, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6.</p>
                  <p>But this walking in all Gods commands does admit
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:192038:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>of divers degrees: all the people of God in this life fall ſhort of perfection, and ſome fall far ſhort of that perfection that others do attain: every one that is travelling in a path, don't travel with equal dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſpeed: ſo here, ſome are more dull, heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and negligent than others are: and many Saints do fall ſhort in reſpect of ſome outward commands of ſome that are but natural men: but every one muſt have ſuch a meaſure of obedience to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as ſpeaks faithfulneſs: ſuch as ſpeaks a ſpirit of fear, faith and love: there muſt not be an heart allowance of any ſin: the conſcience of a natural man, may allow none; but the heart and will of a Saint does allow none: there are many ſins which a chriſtian does commit often in a day, as the actings of unbelief, by-ends, worldly affections, and pride; but yet he does not allow them, and his diſallowance is ſeen in acts of hatred towards theſe ſins, repenting of them, watching againſt them out of hatred, and by his performing contrary actions, namely, of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where there is an holy life, this walking in Gods commands is in a courſe: that is their way; and manner and trade: whatever exactneſs a man may have for a fit, that will not denominate his life holy: he that leads an holy life, is in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe attending the rules of holineſs, and that not only rules of external obedience, but alſo of internal, reaching after the glory of God, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to do duties with an upright heart, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful againſt the ſecret motions of ſin, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. <hi>and herein do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have always a conſcience void of offence towards God and towards man:</hi> ſuch perſons as have pangs upon their hearts to walk in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:192038:136"/>Gods ways, and then leave off again are far from an holy life: that is the ſpirit of a wicked man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.31. <hi>he hath left off to be wiſe and to do good:</hi> none can be ſaid to live an holy life, but ſuch as in a courſe are practiſing of the ways of God; and it is thus where there is an inward principle of holineſs: tho' habitual holineſs be not ſufficient in order to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of holineſs without divine aſſiſtance: yet Gods ordinary manner is to aſſiſt all ſorts of principles which he has put into his creatures; and he has promiſed alſo ſpecial aſſiſtance unto grace: ſo that they that have a principle of grace, are walking in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe in the way of holineſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.22. <hi>That thou mayſt walk in the way of good men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though they that lead an holy life keep Gods commands in a courſe, yet they are guilty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſinning againſt God: the corruption that is in the heart of a Saint, is making continual oppoſition unto holineſs: as for the external part of it, many a man attends that, that has not a ſpark of grace, and there is a great deal in a Saint beſides grace that helps him to obſerve the outward part of his duty; pride, covetouſneſs, ſlaviſh fear contribute much to that: but there is abundance of oppoſition to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of obedience, faith, love, &amp;c. and though there be a courſe of holineſs, and time after time an exerciſe of grace, yet it does not follow, that the inward actings of grace are more frequent than the actings of corruption: without queſtion the caſe is far otherwiſe: though grace through the ſpecial preſence of God is getting forward: yet there are in the heart of a Saint abundance more of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of pride then humility, unbelief than faith, earthlineſs than heavenly mindedneſs, the beſt of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:192038:137"/>the Saints have <hi>but a little ſtrength, Rev.</hi> 3.8. a Saint commits a multitude of ſins every day: and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings of grace are few comparatively.</p>
                  <p>And beſides this, though he that leads an holy-life, walks in Gods command in a courſe, yet he may have ſome ſpecial fits of ſinning: as he that is wiſe may in a fit carry him ſelf very fooliſhly, ſo he that is godly, may in a fit carry himſelf very ſinfully: a meek man may have a fit of paſſion as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, and <hi>the Father of the Faithful</hi> may have a fit of unbelief: there are ſometimes when godly men have ſtrong pangs of corruption, and ſin does prevail not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grace, but over conſcience, and reſpect unto their credit, and every thing that ſtands as an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in the way of it: corruption may overflow all its banks, and for a turn a good man may carry himſelf very badly: and ſome of the people of God have more of ſuch diſtempered fits than others have; and they do prevail to a greater height in ſome than in others: but theſe are but fits, the ordinary way of a Saint is a way of obedience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where there is an holy life, this courſe of walking in Gods commands, is out of a gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto God: there be thouſands of actions that are materially good, that are not formally ſo: if they be done meerly from ſelf-love, they are not good: it is neceſſary that they be done out of a gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto God. I rather choſe ſo to expreſs it: then to ſay they muſt be done for the glory of God, becauſe there are ſome internal actings of grace, wherein the ſoul has no end: thus when God draws the heart to love him, the man has no end, thus when the Spirit of God makes a mans heart break for
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:192038:137"/>ſin, he has no deſign in it, when a man ſets himſelf to mourn for ſin he has an end, but when the heart is grieved for ſin, he cannot help it: he has no deſign in that, though he has a motive: and he ever has a gracious reſpect unto God; the glorious excellency of God has an influence upon his heart: that are ſome duties that cannot be done but from a gracious reſpect unto God: there are ſome holy actions that cannot be done but by a principle of grace, as to believe in Jeſus Chriſt to love God to hate ſin: another man that has not grace may imitate theſe, but he can't do them: what faith he has and love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> differs <hi>to-to genere</hi> from the faith and love that is in Saints: theſe holy actions cannot be done but by a gracious reſpect unto God: ſelviſh conſiderations may have ſome influence into theſe, as Gods love to us has ſome influence into our love to him: but in theſe actions the ſoul is principally ſwayed by a gracious reſpect: unto God, <hi>Job.</hi> 42.5, 6. and ſuch other acts of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as may be done meetly upon ſelviſh conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are done by him that lives an holy life princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally upon ſpiritual conſiderations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.42. yet in a ſubordinate way he does, and may make uſe of ſelviſh conſiderations; and ſuch as moral men are ſwayed by: ſuch conſiderations in their place are of weight. God urges them in his Word, as the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of men, the benefit of holineſs, the puniſhment of ſin: men muſt not condemn themſelves, becauſe they have a reſpect unto ſuch things in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7, 22.</p>
                  <p>From this way of Trial we may conclude three ſorts of men to have no true Faith.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Such perſons as live from time to time in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:192038:138"/>unto God: there be pretenders to faith, that live an irreligious and carnal life, if they live not in any ſenſual luſts, yet are indulging themſelves in other ſins, regardleſs of fanctifying the Sabbath, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting prayer, allow themſelves in worldlineſs, pride, malice, and the like: <hi>James</hi> has given us the character of the faith of ſuch men, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Faith without works is dead;</hi> the goſpel is a doctrine accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to godlineſs, there is no more effectual means to purge away ſin than faith in Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tit</hi> 11.12. faith is an heart purifying grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. thoſe that believe Chriſt have ſalvation began in them here, they are ſaved from the dominion of ſin: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe men that do indulge themſelves in any luſt are deſtitute of faith, whatever their pretences be: whatever they tell of their comforts and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, they have but a ſhadow of faith; if they had faith as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, thoſe corruptions would be removed: faith don't work by wantonneſs, and malice, and ſenſuality, and worldlineſs, but by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. ſuch men dream they have faith: can men believe in Chriſt, and be ſervants unto Satan, are men believers, yet rebellious perſons, do men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the grace, and reject the holineſs of God, do men take Chriſt for their Prieſt, and the Devil for their King? if faith were in mens hearts, thoſe luſts would never reſt there, faith would be purging of them out: ſuch unholy perſons do not adorn the Goſpel, but are blemiſhes to the ſocieties to which they do belong: the Scripture gives us an account of the humility, heavenly mindedneſs, love, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal of believers, and if theſe men be believers they are of another kind then the Scripture tells us of; ſuch men do turn the grace of God into wantonneſs, as if Chriſt came into the world to procure them a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:192038:138"/>liherty to ſin without danger: as if the goſpel did countenance iniquity, ſuch men are not guilty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving many others, if the ſinfulneſs of their wayes be known, men may eaſily tell what their faith is, and if they were not ſtark blind, they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves; but if they hope for heaven in this way, they will ſurely be miſtaken: God threatens them with damnation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. they that continue ungodly, will as certainly periſh, as if there were no goſpel, indeed ſuch men are not fit to be ſaved; they are not fit for the company that is in heaven, for the comfort that is there, nor for the employment that is there.</item>
                     <item>2. Such perſons as are obſerving Gods commands only under ſome pangs, for a time they ſet themſelves carefully to do their duty, and make conſcience of their duty, and reform things that are amiſs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they wither away again, and from one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect fall to another, they grow bold to ſin, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of duty; lie in the practiſe of evil: they had a fit of religion but have loſt it: ſuch men have no faith: if men had faith, they would continue in the practiſe of Gods will: <hi>unbelief makes men depart from God, Heb</hi> 3.12. Faith is a preſervative from Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.39. <hi>we are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the ſaving of the ſoul:</hi> ſuch men as have once been zealous in religion and now don't regard it, or live in any way of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience have no true faith: faith will not preſerve men from falling, but it will from falling away, and from a courſe of diſobedience,</item>
                     <item>3. Such perſons as do not walk in Gods commands out of a gracious reſpect unto him: though they be
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:192038:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>exceeding diligent and conſcienſcious: yet they are not acted from ſpiritual conſiderations: they do not duties from a ſpirit of obedience, and for the glory of God, and from a true ſence what a glorious God this is: theſe men have no faith; for they have no true holineſs: they have no faith, for by faith men come to have a ſpiritual underſtanding of the glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God, and if they underſtood that they would ſerve him becauſe he is ſuch: and hence thoſe men that are acted by a principle of morality in their religion have no faith: and thoſe men that are acted only by an enlightned conſcience have no faith: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men are terrified and ſcared into religion, out of a ſpirit of fear they reform and do duty: but this is not real holineſs: an enlightened conſcience is not ſufficient to make a man produce any one holy action: though men abound in duties of religion yet it be not from a right motive, they have no faith, for all their duties are but hypocriſie: not onely when men make it their great end to get wealth and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but when they make it their great end to get peace of conſcience, deliverance from hell, and the joyes of heaven: if ſuch things as theſe be the great things that have an influence into mens reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, God will not accept of it: ſaith makes men ſerve God from a ſpirit of love, <hi>gal.</hi> 5.6.

                     <hi>I fear whether I have any true holineſs, becauſe I ſee

                  </p>
                  <p>There may be ſuch actings of corruption in a ſaint as are inconſiſtent with the actual love of God: but men are often miſtaken, in thinking that ſinful actings are not conſiſtent with the habitual love of God: many times a man ſees ſuch workings of grace as ſeems to him inconſiſtent with ſuch ſinful inclinations as afterwards he finds in his heart: ſo 'tis here, but there is no act of ſin, (the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt excepted) but is conſiſtent with habitual grace: whatever luſt is in the heart, it may be drawn into act notwithſtanding the being of grace: that grace that does not altogether deſtroy the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot altogether hinder the working of it: there needs more than the being of grace, to hinder the workings of the vileſt corruptions, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.9.</p>
                  <p>Doubt 2.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>fear, becauſe in thoſe conflicts that</hi> I <hi>have, ſin gets the upper-hand:</hi> I <hi>ſet my ſelf to carry patiently, and yet am carried away with impatience: and</hi> I <hi>ſet my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a temptation, and yet am out-bid.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>They may be overcome in a particular skirmiſh, that may overcome in the war: a godly man is many times out-bid in his conflicts with corruption, that argues the weakneſs, not the total want of grace, grace is ſometimes under hatches, corruption
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:192038:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>comes like a ſtorm, and bears down all before it: corruption does not only out-bid conſcience, but grace too: if a man throw a bawl right forward, the ſtrength of the bias carries it aſide.</p>
                  <p>Doubt 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I fear, becauſe</hi> I <hi>find a ſpirit in my ſelf to ſeek my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the world, and to mourn for affliction as the greateſt evil:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Every one that has any worldly love, and carnal ſorrow has this ſpirit: worldly love is not a loving of the world, but a loving of it more than God: ſo carnal ſorrow is not a mourning for afflictions, but a mourning for them as the greateſt evil: he that is under the power of worldlineſs, has this ſpirit reigning in him: but godly men ſo far as they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, and acted by a worldly ſpirit do prefer the World above God, and make the world their God: the ſpirit of worldlineſs is to idolize the world: but notwithſtanding this you may love God above the world, and mourn for ſin above any affliction: though there be a ſpirit to prize the world above God, yet there may be another ſpirit in you to prize God above all things, and where there is any degree of true love to God, there is a loving of God above all: the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part loves other things more than God; the regenerate loves God more than all other things.</p>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:192038:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>upon us: God might without the performing of any condition by us have juſtified by Chriſt: as we were made ſinners by the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> without our conſent, ſo might we have been made righteous without our conſent: but it pleaſes God to require a condition, which ſeems to be partly that we may have ſalvation in the way of a covenant which is for our comfort: partly to render them that refuſe the condition the more inexcuſable: the pleaſure of God is the reaſon that there was a condition, and like wiſe that Faith is the condition: if he had made love to himſelf, or ſorrow for ſin the condition, that would have carried a face, as if juſtification were the reward of our works; yet God might have done it if he had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but he has ſtated this law of Grace, <hi>that he that believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Act. 10.43. <hi>whoever believeth on him ſhall have remiſſion of ſins:</hi> this is the covenant of reconciliation: therefore as you do deſire everlaſting bleſſedneſs venture your ſouls upon the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; this is a way of ſafety.</p>
               <p>In urging this Exhortation, I ſhall
<list>
                     <item>1. Preſent ſome Motives before you:</item>
                     <item>2. Mention ſome conſiderations further to inforce thoſe Motives:</item>
                     <item>3. Anſwer ſuch Objections as awakened ſinners are wont to make.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. One Motive, is the great ſin of rejecting of Chriſt, and not coming unto him: men have reaſon to be afraid to continue in unbelief, becauſe there is ſo much ſin and iniquity in it: many a wakened ſinners that do confeſs and bewail other ſins, and ſpeak of them with bitterneſs of ſpirit: do not lye under the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:192038:142"/>ſenſe of this ſin: here they are ready to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or juſtifie themſelves: they don't take the blame of their rejecting of Chriſt to themſelves: they plead for that, and vindicate themſelves as if it was not their fault, as if they had not ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe: but herein you are greatly miſtaken: you look upon your unbelief to be your infirmity and calamity but not your ſin: this is a meer deluſion: the profeſſed rejecting of Chriſt was that which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up the meaſure of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſins: and the heart rejecting of Chriſt is ſin, <hi>John</hi> 16.9. <hi>the comfortes ſhall convince of ſin, becauſe they believe not in me:</hi> and tho this heart rejecting of Chriſt be not a flagitious, yet it is a crying ſin: you cannot anger God more by any thing than by continuing in the neglect of Chriſt: this is the great controverſie that God hath with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not that they have been guilty of theſe or thoſe particular tranſgreſſions, but that they abide in the rejection of the Goſpel: you may ſee the greatneſs of this ſin, by the many rules that are broken by this ſin, and by the fountain of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. See the greatneſs of the ſin by the many laws and rules that are broken by it: men do violate many Commandments at once in this ſin; it is a complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted iniquity, it is not a ſingle ſin, but many evils are twiſted together in it: the rejecting of Chriſt croſſes a great many rules; men by their unbelief do caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of diſhonour upon God, and lie in the breach of many Precepts.</p>
               <p>There are many Rules broken by this ſin; For
<list>
                     <item>1. You break that particular command of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt: believing in Chriſt is not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:192038:143"/>to many general rules, but there is a ſpecial command for it: we may not only argue this duty by conſequence from ſome general Precepts: but here is an expreſs commandment for it; it is <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> required: as we are beſeeched to believe and invited, ſo we are required, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. <hi>this is the work of God, that we believe on him whom he hath ſent,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>this is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> ſo that by neglecting to come to Chriſt, you break a plain expreſs Precept; you carry contrary to the very letter of the Word of God: if it were not ſo expreſly ſet down, there might be more pretence for cavilling: you might have more to plead that there was ſome miſtake in mens argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this to be a duty: but now you do oppoſe a plain direct precept: what colour can men have to queſtion whither it be their duty, when it is ſet down in the Scripture in ſo many letters and ſyllables: ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened ſinners that have reformed their former wayes of ſin, and taken up a courſe of Religion, are apt to pleaſe themſelves that they don't live in any known ſin, whereas they live all the while in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of coming unto Chriſt: but how can you ſooth up your ſelves with this, when you neglect a plain and expreſs Commandment?</item>
                     <item>2. You deny to Jeſus Chriſt the honour of his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorly Office; and of that great Sacrifice that he has offered up unto God: God had made Chriſt Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; he has committed the work of reconciliation unto Chriſt, and Jeſus Chriſt has undertaken it: he was every way furniſhed for it, and has diſcharged it: and upon that account he is worthy to be depended upon: Faith in him is an honour due to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain,</hi> &amp;c. but by
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:192038:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>your rejecting of him, you withhold that honour that belongs to him, you deny him the honour of having made ſatisfaction for ſin: you ſhould honour every one according to their deſert, but you caſt contempt upon his ſacrifice as if it were not ſufficient for you: you diſparage him when you are afraid to venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: you caſt great reflections as if there were no ſuch virtue in his death and righteouſneſs as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: there is a great deal of deſpiſing of Chriſt: you belie him; the language of unbelief is, that his blood is not precious, that it does not cleanſe from all ſin; that his ſacrifice is not pleaſing unto God: that the gold he tenders will not make you rich, that the white Raiment he offers will not hide your ſhame; thus Jeſus is ſlighted and undervalued by every unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; they have low thoughts of Chriſt and carry accordingly.</item>
                     <item>3. You caſt great contempt upon the wiſdom of God in finding out ſuch a way of Salvation: this is a way that God in infinite wiſdom has contrived, <hi>colloſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>there are in Chriſt all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg:</hi> but you do deſert this way as an unſafe way: you dare not venture yourſelves in this way: as if God when he undertook to find out a way to bring ſinners unto glory miſſed it: and did not diſcover a way that will do: that commends this way of life to us that God himſelf contrived it, it is not the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man; a thing plotted and deviſed by any finite underſtanding, but the contrivance of God himſelf: but you by refuſing of Chriſt carry as if this were a deceitful way, as if this way did not reach the needs of your ſoul: this <hi>way</hi> is choſen of God, and refuſed <hi>by you;</hi> as if you underſtood better than God what you needed.</item>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:192038:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <item>4. You refuſe wonderful love: to reject the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love of God is an abuſe of it: you ought with thankfulneſs to entertain Gods love: but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of Chriſt, you reject the greateſt love that ever was revealed: was it not an act of wonderful love for God to ſend his Son to dye for us: what need had he to be at any ſuch coſt, if we had been all damned, what would he have loſt by it? we may ſee in this, how deeply the heart of God was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in our ſalvation: he did that for us which would have been too much for us to have asked: we may well wonder that God would be willing to do ſuch a thing for our ſalvation: it was a great thing for God to be willing that ſinners ſhould be ſaved: but for him to lay out himſelf ſo in order to it was much more, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>ſo God loved the world:</hi> and again, it was a great act of love for God to make ſuch a law of grace: that he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved; that he ſhould make ſo ſmall a thing the condition of ſalvation, and ſay to us as the Prophet did to him, waſh and be clean: if God had laid the ſoreſt burdens upon us, and put us upon never ſo many difficulties as the condition of ſalvation, we ſhould have had reaſon to bleſs his name: but he only lays this condition on us, to accept his offer: it was great love that God ſhould make this offer to you, when he paſſes by thouſands in the world: and never ſpeak a word to them about the way of life, yet opens this way to you, revealing of it, and calling upon you to be ſaved: he caſt your lot in a time when and where theſe offers ſhould be made: and the way of life is held forth with all plainneſs: and when he has ſnatched o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers away younger than you, he is yet waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, keeps knocking at your door; and upon
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:192038:144"/>this account you are utterly inexcuſable in refuſing to come to Chriſt; ſhall God be at a great deal of coſt and care in order to your ſalvation, and will you not accept of his Son? ſhall Chriſt make a journey from heaven to ſave you, and ſhall he loſe his labour? God in compaſſion has provided bread for you, and will you not eat it, a garment for you, and will not put it on; has he ſent a Phyſitian, and will you not accept his help? are Gods bowel, earning over your dying ſouls, and will you reject his care? indeed when you refuſe Chriſt you deſpiſe the tender love of God: and that heart is very hard that can ſlight ſuch tender love: you are guilty of great ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that do reject this offer: you are greatly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious unto God thus to blow upon his love.</item>
                     <item>5. You act contrary to ſelf-love: it is every mans duty to love himſelf, and ſeek his own good: God commands men to proſecute their own good in a way of ſubordination to his glory: God allows no man to ruine himſelf, but requires them to ſeek their own wellfare all their days, <hi>Mat</hi> 6.20. and indeed what ever ſin a man commits he acts contrary to the rule of ſelf-love, all ſin is hurtful and not benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to men: but in a peculiar manner they act contrary to this rule in rejectin of Chriſt, for therein they refuſe a tender of bleſſedneſs: God in the Goſpel is offering ſalvation unto them, if they will but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt, they ſhall immediately be made heirs of bleſſedneſs: ſo that in refuſing Chriſt they reject at once all the glory of heaven, and the great fruits of Chriſts purchaſe, that they might enjoy here in this world: they are enemies to themſelves, put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſalvation from themſelves: you act in this thing like a deadly enemy to your own ſoul; if a man that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:192038:145"/>were poyſoned ſhould refuſe an antidote, if he that was condemned ſhould refuſe a pardon, would they not be therein enemies to themſelves: ſo are you in refuſing Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.36. <hi>all they that hate me love death.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>6. You hereby hinder your ſelves from doing any thing that is good; from doing any thing in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God: by neglecting of Chriſt, you keep your ſelves in a way of diſobedience, the rejecting of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the reaſon why you live an unſpiritual life: your neglecting to come to Chriſt makes you neglect every other ſpiritual duty, you may perform indeed many external duties, and attain unto inward affections, but you will never do any duty in a ſpiritual and acceptable manner, until you come to Chriſt: faith in Chriſt is the firſt act of obedience that any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner does perform: that man that don't believe don't love God, mourn for ſin aright, nor ſeek the glory of God, it <hi>is faith that purifies the heart, Acts</hi> 15.9. it is by faith that a man firſt gives up himſelf to be Gods ſervant, ſo that by neglecting to believe you bring your ſelves under a neceſſity of neglecting every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpiritual duty: this is the reaſon that whatever you do in religion is done in hypocriſie.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You may ſee the greatneſs of this ſin in not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Chriſt, from the fountain from whence it does proceed: in ſecure ſinners it flows nextly from a contempt of ſalvation: their eyes are dazied with the glory of the world; they are unſenſible of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, they regard not the end, and therefore it is no wonder that they do not regard the means: but in awakened ſinners, the neglect of coming to <hi>Chriſt</hi> ariſes from theſe two things.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:192038:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="1">1. Pride: This way of ſalvation by Chriſt don't fuit their proud ſpirits: God has choſen ſuch a way of life as ſuits his glorifying his grace; but it does not ſuit with their naughty hearts: this way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God carries away all the glory don't pleaſe them, and hence it is that they are ſtriving by all ways they can deviſe to find out ſome other method wherein they may have ſalvation; they don't like it to be ſo much beholden unto God, but would fain find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in themſelves to glory in: hence they have an oppoſition of ſpirit to comming unto Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5.40 <hi>you will not come to me that you may have life:</hi> it is not meerly from weakneſs, but from pride and ſturdineſs of ſpirit that they don't come unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From their not believing the teſtimony of God he tells them plainly, that there is righteouſneſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them in Chriſt, that if they will come, they ſhall be ſaved: but they don't lay weight upon the Word of God, Gods Word don't remove their doubts, they are not ſatisfied in the preciouſneſs of Chriſts righteouſneſs, nor in the riches of Gods grace, nor in the ſtability of the covenant: they do not believe the report of the Goſpel, <hi>Iſa</hi> 53: 1. and hence they don't ſee their way clear, they are afraid to come to Chriſt, they imagine it will be preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they think it is a way to get a curſe and not a bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next motive is, the certain ruine of all unbelievers: there is nothing elſe to be expected if you continue to reject Jefus Chriſt but to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever, the miſery that will overtake you is exceeding great, 'tis not poverty, ſickneſs, diſgrace,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:192038:146"/>temporal death, but ſomewhat ten thouſand times worſe then thoſe; this is that that the eternal ſtate of your ſouls turn upon, if you come not unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> you will fall ſhort of everlaſting bleſſedneſs, and muſt take up your abode among Devils, you are now under a poſſibility of enjoying the preſence of God, and dwelling in the higheſt heavens in unſpeakable joy and happineſs, but it is all loſt and gone for ever if you give not entertainment to the invitations of the Goſpel; and after you have ſpent a few days in vanity, you muſt lye down in ſorrow and have your portion in the loweſt hell; death will deliver you into the hands of tormenters, and you ſhall have darkneſs without light, pain without eaſe, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row without joy: it had been better for you if you had never been born: the wrath of God will lie like a talent of lead upon your ſoul: you will have no friends, to comfort you, no worldly enjoyments to refreſh you, no hopes to ſupport you, but muſt ſet your ſelf to bear what you cannot bear, and to endure that which is in tollerable: it may make ones fleſh to tremble, to think what miſeries ſome in this world have endured from cruel enemies, and bloody Perſecuters, but thoſe miſeries were but for a little time, and fell nextly upon the body, and they are not to be compared with thoſe miſeries that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for unbelievers in another world: will it not be a dreadful thing to be ſeparated from the joyes of heaven, and that glorious ſociety that is there, will it not be dreadful to dwell with the Devil and his Angels, will it not be dreadful to be left to the terror of a guilty conſcience, the beginnings where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of here have made many men chooſe death rather than life: will it not be dreadful to be filled brim full with the fiery wrath of God: to have every limb
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:192038:146"/>of thy body, and faculty of thy ſoul as full as it can hold of the indignation of the Almighty; how loth will you be when it comes to, to enter into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; men would ſhrink into nothing if it were poſſible, terrors will take hold upon them as waters, they would fain eſcape out of the hands of revenging Juſtice: how will you draw back when you ſee your ſelves upon the borders of diſtruction: men would be glad that the Rocks would fall upon them, and the hills cover them, ſo they might but eſcape: what will you think of it when the Devil ſhall lay hold of you to drag you down to hell? how will you cry ont when tumbling into the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone? what can comfort you in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? men take great delight here in their worldly enjoyments and pleaſures, but what comfort will it be to have good things when they are tormented in this flame? men comfort themſelves here, that they have laid a foundation of worldly greatneſs for their children, but what comfort will it be to them, to think that their children are eating and drinking, and ſporting, when they are drinking the dregs of the wrath of God: and whatever honour their Sons come to, their fleſh upon them ſhall have pain, and their ſoul within them ſhall mourn: you have much to do now to bear any little affliction, and how do you think to go thorow theſe calamities, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be moderate, where all evils ſhall fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and that in the extremity of them: you will wring your hands, and tear your hair, and gnaſh your teeth, and curſe your day, and fill hell with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries and lamentations: this will be your portion if you continue to reject Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.46. <hi>He ſhall appoint him his portion with unbelievers:</hi> it is not a matter of probability, a thing only to be much ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:192038:147"/>but beyond all queſtion, that you even you are a damned man if you do not entertain the calls of the Goſpel, you are ſpending away your time in delays, but you had need reſolve the caſe, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Chriſt you chuſe miſery, you chuſe death, you chuſe eternal damnation, ſtand out from Chriſt a little longer, you are a gone man: men hope God will not be ſo hard to them as to damn them, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſervices they have done, and the pains that they have taken in religion: but there is one law for all men under the Goſpel: <hi>he that believeth not ſhall be damned, Mat.</hi> 16.16. the unbeliever lies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to damnation on a double account, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his other ſins, and upon the account of his unbelief, <hi>Jeb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation:</hi> let mens other qualifications be what they will, yet if <hi>they believe not, the wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth upon them, Joh.</hi> 3.36. God threatens them in his word with ruine, and thoſe threatnings are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, ſuch as bind him in faithfulneſs to damn eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unbeliever: there are many indefinite threatnings in the Scripture, and many conditional, but theſe are abſolute ones againſt every one that continues in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief: there is no poſſibility for them to eſcape.</p>
               <p>This appears,
<list>
                     <item>1. Becauſe it is contrary to the decree and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God to ſave ſuch as do not believe, the decrees of God are inviolable, it is a vain thing for any man to look for ſalvation contrary to Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: but it is againſt Gods decree to ſave unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not that there is ſuch a formal act in the decree that unbelievers ſhall be damned; but this is a truth ariſing from the decree: for God has determined to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:192038:147"/>give faith unto all thoſe that he has choſen unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he has determined to lead them in a way of faith unto life, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13 <hi>God has choſen you from the beginning unto ſalvation through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth:</hi> all that God has cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen unto life ſhall believe, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>all that the Father has given me ſhall come unto me:</hi> ſo that it is croſs to the decree of God to ſave any man that has not faith, the decree of God is a bar in the way of his ſalvation.</item>
                     <item>2. Becauſe faith is the condition of the covenant of grace: there is one law for all men: there is but one condition of this covenant: <hi>John</hi> 5.24. <hi>he that heareth my words, and believeth in him that ſent me hath everlaſting life, &amp;c.</hi> we are directed to take this way for ſalvation: there is no other way propoſed, in caſe of a failure in this: ſo that the want of this muſt needs exclude men from the good of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the want of this condition renders men unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of life.</item>
                     <item>3. Becauſe it muſt be ſo in Juſtice, and Gods heart is as much upon the glorifying of his Juſtice as his grace: one attribute is as due to him as another, the glorifying of his Juſtice is not a by-buſineſs but a thing that his heart is deeply concerned in: and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice requires the ruine of unbelievers: for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>the wages of ſin is death:</hi> and there is no <hi>way</hi> for Juſtice to be ſatisfied for their ſins but <hi>by</hi> their ruine.</item>
                     <item>4 Becauſe it is foretold and propheſied of, that Chriſt will deſtroy unbelievers when he comes to Judgment: the Scripture gives us an account before
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:192038:148"/>hand of the tranſactions of the day of Judgment; what will be the iſſue of things, and befal theſe and thoſe in that day: and God tells us that unbelievers ſhall be ruined then: he does not only threaten them with ruine, but tells the Saints that ſuch perſons ſhall be ruined, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>he will take vengeance on them that obey not the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 21.8. <hi>the fearful and unbelieving ſhall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. Becauſe the Sentence of God in the Goſpel is that which men ſhall be judged by: God declares in the Goſpel, <hi>that he that believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> and if unbelievers be tried by this rule they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly periſh; if God ſhould try them by ſome other rule that they might fancy or imagine they might make a ſhift to eſcape: but by this rule they are gone men: and this is the rule they muſt be tried by: God will have no reſpect in that day unto mens riches, or learning, or eſteem among men, or their civil or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral converſation; but their caſe muſt be determined by the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>God will judg the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt according to my Goſpel.</hi>
                     </item>

               <p>It is impoſſible for you to eſcape ruin if you do not believe; and that is not all, for your rejecting of Chriſt does not only expoſe you unto condemnation, but to a greater degree of miſery than multitudes will endure that go to hell: you may not think to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape as heathens will do, your load will be heavier, and your fire will be hotter, and your judgment every way ſorer than the judgment of other men; God will proportion every mans miſery to his iniquity: and as you have enjoyed greater light and love, ſo you muſt expect more amazing and exquiſite wrath than other men; conſcience has more to accuſe you of, and condemn you for, and ſo has God: and you will ſink down deeper into hell than other men: you are treaſuring up a greater meaſure of wrath than others againſt the day of wrath. you have bleſſed God it may be many times for the means of Grace that he has beſtowed upon you: but you will curſe your ſelves a thouſand times more for not improving them; you will wiſh that you had lived in the darkeſt corners of the earth, among <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians:</hi> it will be a terror to you to think of your Baptiſm, what books you have read, what Miniſters you have heard, what counſels have been given to you: every ſinner will be in a dreadful condition then: but it will be more tolerable for many than for you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.22, 24.</p>

Life and death are ſet before you, though you have been a grievous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, though you have hardned your heart againſt God along while, though you have rejected counſels, and deſpiſed reproofs, and ſpent your dayes hitherto in ſin; and travelled a great way in the path that leads to death; yet there is no neceſſity of your damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you are capable of ſalvation ſtill, if you will not caſt away your ſelf by continuing in unbelief, you muſt bear it your ſelves, others that laboured after your ſalvation will do well enough, the loſs will be your own: but there is no need of your being ruined; there is yet an open door, and liberty ſet before you, to enter into the moſt holy place if you will but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt you ſhall have ſalvation: you are cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, what muſt I do to be ſaved? you are not ſo ſolicitous for worldly enjoyments, but your care is to go to Heaven, and there is reaſon for it: it is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing to ſee the face of God, to be ſpectators of his glory: the glimpſes of it here are more refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than all the ſweetneſſes of the World: to ſee God, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and all the Attributes of God is moſt delightful, if you go to Heaven, there you will have an uninterrupted ſight of God; you ſhall ſee him as he is, and no clouds ſhall ever darken the ſight of his countenance: then you ſhall have the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding ſenſe of his love: never make any queſtien a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it more, but be delighting therein for ever: then you ſhall be delivered from ſin, and made glorious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the image of God: then you ſhall be with Jeſus Chriſt, it is a comfort to hear of him, but then you ſhall be in his preſence; you have a fame of him now, but then you ſhall ſee him, your eyes ſhall behold your Redeemer; him that is wonderful in his perſon

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:192038:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>caſe, God has been at great expenſe, he has laid out himſelf more for the ſalvation of Believers than he did for the making of the World: he has exerciſed much of his wiſdom on this deſign, much power; yea he gave his only begotten Son, <hi>that whoever believeth on him might not periſh, but might have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh 3, 10. muſt not his heart be much in it when he gave his Son to die? could any thing have induced God to ſuch a ſtrange diſpenſation, had not the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Believers been a thing that his heart was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon? God has by this given conviction to the World, that he is ſet to ſave believers: when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how many wonders God wrought in order to it, how he ſent his Son from heaven, conſtituted him a Mediator, delivered him over unto death, it may give us great ſatisfaction, that God is really bent to ſave them: why ſhould he go ſo far if he did not intend to go thorow: God that has ſpent ſo much for the ſalvation of believers, will ſpend a little more to carry the work on to perfection: God loves his Son too much to let him die in vain; to put him to ſuch ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and then to let the deſign of all his ſufferings fall to the ground.</item>

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:192038:150"/>promiſe: this eternal tranſaction between the Father and the Son, puts the ſalvation of believers beyond all queſtion; God ſtands engaged to Chriſt, and Chriſt is ſet in his ſpirit to have this engagement fulfilled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every believer: Chriſt is not willing to loſe one believer but claims the promiſe, and is ſet for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>John</hi> 17.20. <hi>I pray for them alſo that ſhall believe on me through their word:</hi> and what does he deſire for them? among other things, <hi>that they may be where he is, to behold his glory,</hi> ver. 24.</item>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:192038:151"/>be ſo, if it were not a way of life and bleſſedneſs: God would let men alone and never buſie himſelf ſo to perſwade them to believe in Chriſt if the life of their ſouls did not depend upon it: it would not be worth the while, for God with a great deal of care, and by many wonderful works of his ſpirit to bring men to believe, if this were not the way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it would not become the wiſdom and goodneſs of God to labour in this manner to perſwade men to believe, if this were not the way of life.</item>

There is nothing in God to compel him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſinner: what ſhould force God to damn you, if you be never ſo bad, yet God is not neceſſitated to reject you; his holineſs does not compel him: the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God is no impediment to the exerciſing of pardoning grace: there is a Scripture that looks that way, <hi>Joſh</hi> 24.19. <hi>ye cannot ſerve the Lord, for he is an holy God, he is a jealous God, he will not forgive your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, nor your ſins:</hi> but the meaning of it is, that they were ſuch a perverſe people that they could not
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:192038:157"/>ſerve God ſo, but that they would bring his judgments on them; for he is ſo holy as that he will puniſh his viſible people while they go on in wayes of degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy: but his holineſs and his grace don't thwart one another: for it is no prejudice to the intereſt of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that God pardons great ſinners: for when God pardons he ſanctifies too: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. neither is the Juſtice of God any hinderance to the exerciſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy: juſtice forbids pardon without ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made, but not if there be ſatisfaction, if the Law which is the rule of Juſtice be attended, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to the juſtice of God: the Law makes no diſtinction between great and little ſinners, great ones are capable of pardon as well as others if there be ſatisfaction: the law admits of the pardon of no ſin without ſatisfaction, but it admits of the pardon of any ſin if there be ſatisfaction: neither does Gods care of his glory hinder him from pardoning of great ſinners, for he can turn that to the advantage of his glory: the pardoning of ſuch is greatly ſubſervient unto that deſign, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7.</item>

               <p>Such threatnings as this are only declarations of what God does oftentimes do: there are ſome threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that are abſolute; wherein God does abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare what he will do: ſuch are the threatnings of ruine for final impenitency and unbelief: but many other threatnings are but declarations of what God oftentimes does, and in their application to particular perſons are to be underſtood with a condition: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that rule, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18 7, 8. ſo that ſuch perſons may be ſayed if they do repent: this is evident not only from the many invitations in the Scripture that reach and comprehend ſuch ſinners as well as others: but from hence alſo, that the generality of thoſe whom the Lord accepts have been guilty of rejecting many reproofs, the generality of the Saints have lived to Mens and Womens eſtates, under means before they yielded any real obedience unto God: therefore this

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:192038:159"/>that the Spirit of God has forſaken them, is becauſe the ſpirit does after a while change its way of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: when the Spirit begins to work upon them, his manner is to diſcover their danger, and after a while to give them ſome encouragement, whereby they come to have ſtrong affections, ſorrow, deſire, delight, and now they are eaſily perſwaded that the Spirit is at work with them, and dont look upon themſelves har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, but after a while, when theſe affection fail them, and they find themſelves dull and ſenſeleſs, now they are afraid that the Spirit has left them: whereas the reaſon is, the ſpirit has changed his work, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſhew them what hearts they have in order, to the work of Humiliation: if men could maintain their lively affections they would never come to Chriſt: therefore the Spirit of God does leave them unto, and lead them into an experimental knowledg of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their hearts: ſo that this is no ſign of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits leaving you, but an effect of the preſence of the Spirit: his manner is to convince men that they are poor and wretched, and blind, and miſerable, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.</item>

The conditional offer of the goſpel is made to you how hard ſoever your heart is: you are called, and if you will accept you ſhall be ſaved: God rejects none that come to him by Chriſt: do you accept the goſpel and God will never object your hard-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt you: he never turned any away, becauſe their hearts were hard: come to him and he will give you pardon, and a ſoft heart too.</item>

<list>
                     <item>1. This is an honour due to God and Jeſus Chriſt: it becomes us to be putting honour upon them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niewing thoſe acts of Faith, when a man is drawing his encouragement from the righteouſneſs of Chriſt,

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:192038:166"/>though a man be in the dark about his condition, yet the very actings of Faith will ſupport his heart: Faith diſcovers a reſting place for the ſoul: in the exerciſe of Faith, the ſoul is receiving of encouragement: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith is often expreſſed in Scripture by joy, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.18. indeed there is a ſweetneſs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingneſs in the exerciſes of every grace, becauſe they are ſuitable to that new nature that God has put into his Saints; but there is a ſpecial ſweetneſs in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Faith, becauſe the nature of it is to entertain a well grounded comfort and encouragement: the very actings of Faith have a great deal of comfort in them, and the reflection of the ſoul upon thoſe acts of Faith has a great deal of comfort in them: Faith it ſelf is comfortable, and the ſight of Faith is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable: Faith comforts as it entertains the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Goſpel, as it diſcovers a door of hope: the light of Faith comforts as it diſcovers a ſure evidence of Salvation.</item>

               <p>Saints are apt to be diſcouraged from believing on
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:192038:166"/>the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for acceptance: there are two ſorts of diſcouragements that Chriſtians have with reſpect unto their acceptance: one ſort is when they are diſcouraged as if they were not accepted, as if they were not ſaints, and in a ſtate of ſalvation: their preſent ſtate is dark unto them: and this ariſes either from Gods diſpenſations towards them, or their carriages towards God: God layes afflictions upon them, exerciſes them with inward temptations, don't give aſſurance of his love; don't anſwer their prayers, don't quicken their hearts in his Ordinances: and they are carried away with corruption, don't feel the working of love in their hearts, have not ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual hearts as others of the people of God, and ſo they are ready to ſink, as if their preſent ſtate were not a ſtate of peace with God: the other ſort of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is when they are afraid to come unto Chriſt for acceptance: they are called upon to believe, but are diſcouraged from that duty: it don't enter into them that God is free to accept of them through Chriſt: they dare not believe: and theſe two ſorts of diſcouragements are generally Companions, and go together, though not alwayes: uſually when Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are diſcouraged as to their preſent ſtate, they are alſo more backward to believe than at other times: and their hearts are frighted becauſe of the greatneſs and number of their ſins: and when they are in an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving frame, they are many times diſcouraged as if they were not Saints, and can't diſcern thoſe ſigns that they can ſee plain enough at another time: this latter ſort of diſcouragement whereby Saints are diſcouraged from believing in Chriſt is, that we are now diſcourſing of: and this diſcouraged frame is one of thoſe frames that are contrary to a believing frame: there are two other frames in Chriſtians that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:192038:167"/>to believing in Chriſt: one is a ſlighty, careleſs and regardleſs frame of ſpirit reſpecting acceptance with God and eternal ſalvation, mens hearts are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo deeply engaged in the world, that they are little concerned about the ſtate of their ſouls, they have not the weight of it on their hearts, to make ſure a part in Chriſt; ſometimes Chriſtians are under the prevailings of a ſenſleſs Spirit, they have not ſenſe nor ſolemnity enough upon their hearts to put forth an act of Faith: the other is a ſelf-righteous frame, whereby Chriſtians are apt to be drawing of their encouragements for their acceptance with God from their own righteouſneſs: but beſides theſe there is a diſcouraged frame of ſpirit whereby Saints are afraid to believe; as if there were not encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough to believe, in the offers of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to them: this diſcouraged frame of ſpirit is, that we ſhall particularly conſider of, as being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the doctrine of our ſafe appearing in Chriſts righteouſneſs, which has been cleared up in the former part of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>That Saints are very apt to be diſcouraged from believing is evident from the univerſal experience of the people of God; they find it a difficult thing to live a life of Faith, and find many doubtings ariſing in their hearts, many jealouſies that their hearts are ſuggeſting: they are apt to be diſcouraged from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving for other things, outward bleſſings, divine aſſiſtance, and whatever God has promiſed, and thus it is alſo with reſpect unto their acceptance with God: were they not ſo apt to be diſcouraged they would live a more ſweet and comfortable life than they do: the Diſciples of Chriſt were <hi>ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have written,</hi> Luk. 24.25.

                  <p>That the law of God leaves as much room for the pardon of great fins as of little ones: leſſer ſins and greater ſins are all mortal by the law, by the ſentence of the law, one ſin is as certainly deſtructive as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand: <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. and the Law does allow of the pardon of multitudes as well as of one: the Law allows of the pardon of ſin; provided there be ſatisfaction, the Law ſtands upon it to have puniſhment, but it does not ſtand for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal puniſhment; in caſe of great ſins no more than in caſe of little ſins the Law makes no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:192038:171"/>but it gives as much liberty for the pardon of great offenders as of leſſer, there is no tittle that way in the covenant of works, that great ſinners muſt dye in their own perſons: the thing that the Law looks at is, that ſin be puniſhed according to the demerit thereof, that the Juſtice of God be vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but God does not bind up his own hands, that he may not forgive great ſinners, he reſerves that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to himſelf in the law of puniſhing any ſins in a ſurety, and ſo of pardoning them: the law ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the pardon of any ſin if there be ſatisfaction: the reaſon that the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, is not from any thing in the covenant of works, but becauſe God when he provided a ſurety, made an exception of that ſin: but if ſin be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the law is ſatisfied: the law does not forbid the pardon of great ſinners: that is evident, becauſe God does pardon great ſinners, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. <hi>her ſins which are many are forgiven.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. God is as free to pardon hypocrites as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, if they come unto Jeſus Chriſt: the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are afraid many times that they are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, but that ſhould not diſcourage them from believing; hypocrites are as wellcome to come unto Chriſt as Saints: God does not exclude thoſe that have lived long in a way of hypocriſie: they may

                  <p>Conſider, 1.</p>
                  <p>The only reaſon why God ſets his love on one man and not upon another is, becauſe he pleaſes: he acts the ſoveraignty of his own will in it: it is his own will that makes the difference between men, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 4.7. <hi>who maketh this to differ from another, and what haſt thou that thou haſt not received,</hi> Rom 9.15. <hi>I will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon whom I will have mercy:</hi> God in loving of men acts arbitrarily, he acts as the Potter in forming his Veſſels to divers uſes out of the ſame lump: the with of God is ſufficient to move him to chuſe one and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe another, he can beſtow his love upon men where there is nothing in them to draw it, the will of God can act independently, and indeed it cannot have a dependance upon any other thing: there is nothing out of God that can incline the will of God; all thoſe things that men are apt to ſuppoſe to have an influence upon the will of God, have indeed a dependance upon
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:192038:173"/>his will: there is nothing in any man to ſway the will of God any way: there is nothing in any man to be an argument with the Lord to love him; nothing that can work upon the affection of God to make God love him: he has no excellency that can perſwade the Lord to love him: whatever beauty, underſtanding, good nature he has, thoſe things can't ſway God: God is not taken with thoſe excellencies and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are in men, as to have his heart faſtened and allured to them thereby: and on the other hand, there is nothing in man that can hinder God from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him if the man be weak in underſtanding, of contemptible and wicked Parents, and his outward condition mean, yet God can ſet his heart upon him: there is nothing in this and that man that can have any efficacy upon the Lord to make him hate him: there is nothing in man that can byas the will of God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, to love him or hate him; but God herein acts from his meer pleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence it follows, that this or that particular man is as capable of being loved of God as any other in the World: God has manifeſted ſpecial love unto thouſands of men and women, and you are as capable an object of divine ſove as any of them; you are as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable as <hi>Abrahum, Moſes, David, Paul,</hi> or any other: it is true you are as capable of Gods hatred alſo as any other: the meer pleaſure of God does decide it, who ſhall be the objects of his love and his hatred: you have no reaſon to be diſcouraged becauſe you can find no reaſon in your ſelf of Gods love, thoſe that God did ſet his love upon could find no reaſon in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of Gods love: though you be mean and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, yet you are as capable to be an object of Gods love as any other; I do not ſay, that one man is under

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:192038:174"/>evil workings of heart, and therefore they fear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God has accepted of them, or be willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them, and to beſtow ſalvation upon them, did they walk in the light of the Lord, and enjoy ſuch communion with God as they expected, and feel ſuch evident fruits of the love of God as they promiſed themſelves they ſhould not be ſo backward to believe; but ſince it is otherwiſe, it begets a trembling and fearfulneſs in them, it puts them to a great ſtand, hence the calls of God take leſs impreſſion on them: eſpecially becauſe they think it is not ſo with others that come to Chriſt; others do enjoy more manifeſt tokens of divine acceptance, but they are both in inward and outward reſpects under tokens of divine diſpleaſure: and this is an hindrance unto their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, <hi>Job</hi> 9 16, 17. <hi>If I had called and he had anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet would I not believe that he had bearkened to my voice, for he breaketh me with a tempeſt, and multiplieth my wounds without cauſe.</hi>

                  <p>Conſider, 1.</p>
                  <p>That many ſad and ſorrowful diſpenſations are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the favour of God: men are ready to think that if God delighted in them, he could not find in his heart to exerciſe them in ſuch a manner, his compaſſion would work ſo towards them, that they ſhould not experience ſuch ſorrows: but men greatly miſtake, it is true that all the wayes of God are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them that fear him: but yet many times his wayes are in appearance contrary unto love; it is common with God to bring thoſe that he has rejected into a proſperous condition, they are under very ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:192038:174"/>providences; and on the other hand God fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently frowns upon his own children, not only in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal diſpenſations, but alſo by inward darkneſs, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to conflict with ſore temptations; the love of God to his people, is not an affection, as love in men is; but it is a deſign to make them happy: not to beſtow all thoſe degrees of bleſſedneſs upon them that he can, but it is with ſubſerviency to a greater deſign, even the glory of his Name; and therefore he leads them to happineſs in ſuch a way as is conducible to the manifeſtation of the glory of his pardoning grace, his holineſs and ſoveraignty; and it is frequent with God to lay very heavy afflictions upon his deareſt children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.14. <hi>all the day long I have been plagued and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened every morning:</hi> and God leaves his ſometimes to a great deal of inward darkneſs: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15. <hi>while I ſuffer thy terrors I am diſtracted: men that fear the Lord may be in darkneſs, and have no light,</hi> Iſai. 50.10. the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God unto <hi>Job</hi> and the iſſue of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between him and his friends ſtand upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to ſatisfie the hearts of Gods people in all ages in this particular.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God does ſometimes withdraw from his own children the ſenſible quicknings of his ſpirit; God never takes away wholly his ſanctifying preſence from his people: God is preſent with them to uphold the being of grace, there is a divine manutenency whereby God does preſerve the life of grace at all times: but the ſenſible quicknings of his ſpirit may be often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: God may often ſo far withdraw, that they may not perceive any ſpecial gracious operation of the ſpirit upon their hearts: and that as at other times, ſo in duties of worſhip: they may be left many times under great dulneſs and ſenſleſneſs; left much to the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:192038:175"/>ſtonineſs of their own hearts, without any ſpecial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made on them by the ſpirit of God: there are times when God makes their hearts burn within them: but there are times when they are left unto a benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med frame of ſpirit, as if they had no ſpiritual ſenſes, they have great cauſe of joy, but their hearts do not rejoyce therein, great cauſe of ſorrow, but unaffected with it, great cauſe of fear, but fearleſs; their ſenſes are bound up, and ſpiritual truths that they think of or hear of don't ſink into them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.5. <hi>They all ſlumbred and ſlept.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The people of God ought not to count it a frown that they have not the immediate light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance frequently: we muſt have a care that we do not complain without cauſe: the ſealings of Gods ſpirit are wonderful mercies, and ſpecial and more immediate diſcoveries of the love of God are glorious enjoyments: but it is not Gods manner with his people to give them frequently: when God beſtows them he expects that men ſhould go in the ſtrength of them many dayes: <hi>Paul</hi> was but once <hi>caught up to Paradiſe</hi> in his life time, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. God has many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes to ſupport the hearts of his people.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Gods manner is, to be training up his people to live a life of Faith: to be depending upon him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his word, he is ſtriving to bring his ſaints to live upon his promiſe, he does in his providences put them upon that, he takes away other props that they may lean upon the promiſe more, they ſhall have time enough hereafter to ſee things; in heaven Faith will be ſwallowed up in viſion: but here he would have them live by Faith upon his Word; the people of God are apt to have too much dependance upon ſigns, and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:192038:175"/>to lay more weight upon them than upon the Word of God: truſting more to ſigns, and ſometimes to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ones, than they do unto the infallible teſtimony of God: and upon that account God many times takes ſignes away: Chriſtians have enough left them to live upon when ſigns are gene: God many times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the weakneſs of his Saints as he did the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Thomas,</hi> John 20.27, but yet he is by degrees bringing them more off from a dependance upon ſigns to live upon his bare word: they are apt to make too much of their ſignes, and too little of his Word; therefore he takes them away that they may have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Word to truſt to, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>for we walk by Faith and not by ſight.</hi>

                  <p>That it is no preſumption to come unto Chriſt and rejoice in him: how ſinful ſoever you be: though yon feel your heart very hard, though you have juſt now done ſomewhat provoking unto God, and have not yet bewailed it before God, nor been labouring with your own heart to work the ſence of the evil of it upon your own heart: it is a preſumptuous thing
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:192038:177"/>to ſin: men are too bold and daring when they take upon them to croſs the commands of God: and it is a preſumptuous thing to make light of ſin, becauſe Chriſt has died and ſalvation is procured by him: ſin is never the leſs heinous becauſe Chriſt has died: Gods mercy in pardoning of ſin, ſhould make us more ſenſible of the evil of it: but it can be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to come to Chriſt, though the heart be hard and ſenſeleſs: becauſe there is enough in <hi>Chriſt</hi> for ſuch as are hard hearted, there is that preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the blood of Chriſt, that it has procured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin for ſuch, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.19. and pardon is freely offered to you, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.33. <hi>whoever believeth on him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins;</hi> and it is no preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption for you to accept of what God freely offers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and indeed if your eyes be opened to ſee the glorious excellency of Chriſt, and the grace of God, you will not make an excuſe of an hard heart.</p>

Entertaining the calls of the Goſpel is the way to have a ſpirit of repentance: it is meet that you ſhould repent and have your heart broken for your ſins, but the way to come at it, is to entertain the Goſpel offer; there are other means in their place to be uſed, but a principal means in order to repentance is to receive Chriſt: believing in Chriſt is the way to have grace quickned and ſtrengthned: Faith in Chriſt is the greateſt furtherance of repentance and holineſs: Faith diſcovering the grace of God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, melts the heart for ſin, and arms the heart againſt it: and Faith in Chriſt is the great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Goſpel for the ſubduing of ſin, in this way God will give his Spirit to work repentance and holineſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live by Faith in the Son of God,</hi> Iſa. 6.56. <hi>he that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi>

                     <p>Diligently attend the Ordinances of God unto that end: the Ordinances of God have a tendency to ſtir up Faith, as well as other graces, and it is in that way that God has promiſed his preſence and Spirit: God delights to be found in ways appinted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: God has not ſaid that we ſhould ſeek him in vain; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.19.

Gods very preſcribing of means is an encouragement unto us to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, eſpecially when he has annexed his promiſe to the ſame: if men be remiſs and ſlighty in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon Gods Ordinances, they are not likely to thrive in faith, or any other grace, it would be no wonder if they ſhould wither away, and live in a dark diſcouraged condition: but if chriſtians be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to attend Ordinances, and improve them for the ſtrengthning of their faith: they are in a hopeful way to thrive: no wonder if there be a blaſt upon the inventions of men: but experience teaches the people of God to ſay: <hi>it is good for us to draw nigh unto God,</hi> Pſal. 73 28. God can make faith to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh without Ordinances, and ſo he can maintain mens bodily ſtrength without food, he can reveal himſelf to thoſe that ſeldom wait upon him, but his manner is to dole out his ſpiritual gifts at his own gates, he can make them flouriſh elſe where if he pleaſe; but he chooſes to do it in his own courts, <hi>Pſal</hi> 92.13, 14. the Pſaimiſt might have underſtood the

God has appointed the place where we ſhall meet with him, and there we muſt wait for him: if men deſire to flouriſh in faith, they muſt be diligently improving Ordinances that way: God loves to honour his own Ordinances, and help his people in a way of Obedience, and give forth his preſence in ſuch a way that they may ſee his faithfulneſs as well as his mercy: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that you do not under any pretences grow neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in waiting upon God: ſome men are carried away with a ſluggiſh ſpirit, they cannot endure to take the pains to wait upon God conſtantly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, they love their eaſe, and indulge themſelves in a lazy way of carrying an end their religion; and ſome are carried away with a worldly ſpirit, they are <hi>Martha</hi> like cumbring themſelves with much bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, involving themſelves ſo deep in the world, that they can find little leaſure to wait upon God, their worldly buiſineſs over-rules their religion: if you give way to theſe luſts, conclude upon it that you will not thrive in faith: you muſt be content with a little faith, that give way to a ſlighty ſpirit in waiting upon God: you never knew an eminent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever that was not a great prizer of Ordinances, in this way there is hope that Faith will increaſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diligently attend them: Particularly:
<list>
                           <item>1. Read the Word of God diligently: it is very uſeful to this end, to read the writings of faithful and experienced men, ſuch books are of great uſe for the underſtanding of the Scripture: but there is a peculiar uſefulneſs in the Word of God it ſelf, becauſe that is without error and miſtake, <hi>it is given
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:192038:178"/>by inſpiration from God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. in other mens writings you have the judgment of men, and many times their judgments are according to the Word of God, and cleard up from thence, but in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you have the teſtimony of God himſelf: there is a divine authority in the Scripture: the Scripture is the ſentence of God, a meſſage from God: it is cloathed with divine Majeſty: the Word of God has a power over the conſcience: there is ſecret vertue in it to ſtir up Faith: there is a majeſty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding authority in the Scripture: yea the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſanctified by God to work upon the hearts of men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. <hi>theſe are written, that ye might believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God:</hi> there is a ſpecial advantage in it, to hear God ſpeaking in his own language.</item>
                           <item>2. Frequently attend the preaching of the Word: that which God makes uſe of eſpecially for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geting of Faith, is very proper for the nouriſhing of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing, by the Word of God:</hi> this is an ordinance as well as the reading of the Word: and there is a ſpecial uſefulneſs in it ſeveral ways, the life and zeal that is in the delivery is of ſpecial uſe, and a great means to affect the heart: in the preaching of the Word, counſels and encouragements are directed more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly unto them; and that by thoſe that God has ſet over them, that muſt give an account of their ſouls, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. yea the very ſolemnity of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, does help to ſolemnize the heart, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to receive what is ſpoken from the Word of God. And therefore you ſhould be forward to take opportunities for the hearing of the Word: men had need have weighty grounds before they remove to
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:192038:179"/>ſuch places, where they are like to live many years without the preaching of the Word, on to ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they and their families can ſeldom come to the Publick Aſſembly, and you had need be careful that you do not make frivolous excuſes to ſtay away from the Houſe of God: if the weather be difficult, or if there be ſome ſmall bodily indiſpoſition, many count they have a good warrant to ſtay at home: perſons that could overlook ſuch difficulties in order to a worldly deſign; and although there be more liberty, reſpecting weekly opportunities, eſpecially in neighbour places, yet you had need have the weight of thoſe two things upon your heart, that you don't caſt contempt upon the Ordinance of God, and that you don't neglect the advantages that God gives for ſpiritual profit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.1 <hi>I was glad, when they ſaid unto me, let us go into the Houſe of the Lord.</hi>

                           <item>3.

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:192038:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>partake of it without Faith is a ſin: and ſo deſerves damnation, and ſo it does to pray or hear without Faith: yet when the Apoſtle ſays that <hi>he that eateth and drinketh unworthily: eateth and drinketh damnation or judgment to himſelf,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.21. he intends parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that evil of not diſtinguiſhing this eating and drinking from common eating or drinking: do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it either ignorantly or profanely: therefore he adds, <hi>not diſcerning the Lords Body.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>4. Be earneſt with God in prayer for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Faith: Chriſt prayed for <hi>Peter</hi> on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32. and on the ſame account we ſhould pray for our ſelves: prayer is the way to win any thing that we need from God: importunate prayer is like the <hi>ſword of Saul that returned not empty:</hi> tho' the people of God are compaſſed with infirmities, yet their prayers are very prevailing, <hi>Elias was a man of like paſſions,</hi> yet his prayers were ſucceſsful: God loves to gratifie his people, he takes delight in the exerciſe of their graces in prayer, he loves to encourage them in waiting on him according to his appointment: therefore conſtantly attend this duty, and be much in ſecret prayer: be often pouring out your heart unto him: this is duty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6 6. and in this way chriſtians have much communion with God, whereby their faith is ſtrengthned: ſuch chriſtians as can make ſhift ſo to ſtifle their conſciences as to be negligent in this duty: loſe a great advantage for their flouriſhing in faith and holineſs.</item>
                           <item>5. In caſe of need adviſe with thoſe that can help you: when under darkneſs and temptation have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſuch as can direct you: that can ſpeak <hi>words in ſeaſon to them that are weary:</hi> make uſe of

                           </item>
                           <item>6. Rely upon God in Chriſt to maintain Faith in you; it is needful to have all your expectation from him; if men be in the uſe of means for the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of Faith: and truſt to their own endeavours, they give God occaſion to blaſt their labours, and leave them to the doubtings and diſcouragements of their own hearts: no wonder if God lets them fall, that truſt to their own ſtrength: you are not able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſpirit of Faith in your ſelves, nor to fortifie your hearts againſt diſcouragements, by any power or wiſdom of your own, therefore it is fit you ſhould depend on God in Chriſt to work it in you: Chriſt is our under aker to preſerve Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>He is the author and finiſher of Faith:</hi> therefore be not proud of your own ſtrength, but under a ſence of your own inability rely on Chriſt to work it in you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</item>

Chriſtians ſhould be able to give a reaſon of the hope that is in them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. when they are under doubts, a little information about the way of ſalvation by the goſpel, does remove their doubts: therefore labour to get a diſtinct knowledg of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: that you may be able to give account of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God in it, as it is revealed in the goſpel: of the equity of it, and its conſiſtency with the Law: of the abſolute freedome of the grace of God, of the true reaſon why Chriſt died, of the terms of the covenant of Grace, and of the manner of Gods dealing with his when he brings them into union with Chriſt, and after their union with him: a clear knowledg of theſe and ſuch like things are of great advantage unto faith two wayes.</p>

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:192038:183"/>does prejudice men againſt believing: when a man is in ſuch a frame, he conſtrues all Gods difpenſations to be from want of love: he thinks if God had any love for him, he would never have dealt ſo with him, if God had had a kindneſs for him, he would have done this for him and prevented this or that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: but he takes it as a ſign that God don't regard him; when froward he puts the worſt ſenſe upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing: and repreſents Gods diſpenſations to himſelf, as flowing from want of love; he is ready to ſay as ſhe, <hi>how canſt thou ſay, I love thee,</hi> Judg. 15.15. yea frowardneſs makes a man juſtifie his unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: it ſo blinds him, as it did <hi>Jonah,</hi> that he thinks he does well: &amp; vindicates himſelf as if he had cauſe for what he did.</item>
                           <item>2.
